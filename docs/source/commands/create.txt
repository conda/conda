Create a new conda environment from a list of specified packages.  To use the created environment, invoke the binaries in that environment's bin directory or adjust your PATH to look in that directory first.  This command requires either the -n NAME or -p PREFIX option.

**usage**: ``conda create [-h] [--yes] [--dry-run] [-f FILE] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [-n NAME | -p PREFIX] [-q] [package_spec [package_spec ...]]``

*package_spec*
        specification of package to install into new environment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --yes                 do not ask for confirmation
  --dry-run             only display what would have been done
  -f FILE, --file FILE  filename to read package specs from
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        additional channel to search for packages. These are searched in the order they are given, and then the defaults or channels from .condarc (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to get the system packages, which also takes .condarc into account.
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  name of environment (directory in ROOT_DIR/envs)
  -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        full path to environment prefix (default: ROOT_DIR)
  -q, --quiet           do not display progress bar

examples:
    conda create -n myenv sqlite
