Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
Normally, only the specified package is removed, and not the packages

**usage**: ``conda remove [-h] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--all] [--features] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [-n NAME | -p PREFIX] [-q] [package_name [package_name ...]]``

Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
Normally, only the specified package is removed, and not the packages

*package_name*
        package names to remove from environment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --yes                 do not ask for confirmation
  --dry-run             only display what would have been done
  --all                 remove all packages, i.e. the entire environment
  --features            remove features (instead of packages)
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        additional channel to search for packages. These are searched in the order they are given, and then the defaults or channels from .condarc (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to get the system packages, which also takes .condarc into account.
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  name of environment (directory in ROOT_DIR/envs)
  -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        full path to environment prefix (default: ROOT_DIR)
  -q, --quiet           do not display progress bar

examples:
    conda remove -n myenv scipy
