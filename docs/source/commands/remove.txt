Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
Normally, only the specified package is removed, and not the packages

**usage**: ``conda remove [-h] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--all] [--features] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [-n NAME | -p PATH] [-q] [package_name [package_name ...]]

Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
Normally, only the specified package is removed, and not the packages``

*package_name*
        package names to remove from environment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --yes                 do not ask for confirmation
  --dry-run             only display what would have been done
  --all                 remove all packages, i.e. the entire environment
  --features            remove features (instead of packages)
  -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                        additional channel to search for packages. These are URLs searched in the order they are given (including file:// for local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to get the system packages, which also takes .condarc into account. You can also use any name and the .condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is http://conda.binstar.org/
  --override-channels   Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
  -n NAME, --name NAME  name of environment (in ROOT_DIR/envs)
  -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                        full path to environment prefix (default: ROOT_DIR)
  -q, --quiet           do not display progress bar

examples:
    conda remove -n myenv scipy
