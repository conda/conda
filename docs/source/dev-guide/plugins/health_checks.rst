Health Checks
=============

Conda doctor can be extended with the ``health_checks`` plugin hook.
Write new health checks using the ``health_checks`` plugin hook, install the plugins you wrote and they will run every time ``conda doctor`` command is run.
The ``action`` function is where you specify the code you want to be executed with ``conda doctor``.
