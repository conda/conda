Conda build framework
=====================

Building a package requires a recipe.  A recipe is flat directory which
contains the following files:

  * ``meta.yaml`` (metadata file)
  * ``build.sh`` (Unix build script which is executed using bash)
  * ``bld.bat``  (Windows build script which is executed using cmd)
  * ``run_test.py`` (optional Python test file)
  * patches to the source (optional, see below)
  * other resources, which are not included in the source and cannot be
    generated by the build scripts.

The same recipe should be used to build a package on all platforms.

When building a package, the following steps are invoked:

  1. read the metadata
  2. download the source (into a cache)
  3. extract the source in a *source directory*
  4. apply the patches
  5. create a *build environment* (build dependencies are installed here)
  6. run the actual build script. The current working directory is the source
     directory with environment variables set. The build script installs into
     the build environment
  7. do some necessary post processing steps: shebang, rpath, etc.
  8. add conda metadata to the build environment
  9. package up the new files in the build environment into a conda package
  10. test the new conda package:
      - create a *test environment* with the package (and its dependencies)
      - run the test scripts

There are example recipes for many conda packages in the `conda-recipes
<https://github.com/continuumio/conda-recipes>`_ repo.

The :ref:`conda skeleton <skeleton_ref>` command can help to make skeleton recipes for common
repositories, such as `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.


The meta.yaml file
------------------


All the metadata in the recipe is specified in the ``meta.yaml`` file. All sections are optional except for package/name and package/version.

.. code-block:: yaml


    package:
      name: bsdiff4       # lower case name of package, may contain '-' but no spaces
      version: "1.1.4"    # version of package. Should use the PEP-386 verlib
                          # conventions. Note that YAML will interpret
                          # versions like 1.0 as floats, meaning that 1.0 will
                          # be the same as 1. To avoid this, always put the
                          # version in quotes, so that it will be interpreted
                          # as a string.

    source:
      # The source section specifies where the source code of the package is coming
      # from, it may be coming from a source tarball like:
      fn: bsdiff-1.1.14.tar.gz
      url: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/b/bsdiff4/bsdiff4-1.1.4.tar.gz
      md5: 29f6089290505fc1a852e176bd276c43
      sha1: f0a2c9a30073449cfb7d171c57552f3109d93894
      sha256: 5a022ff4c1d1de87232b1c70bde50afbb98212fd246be4a867d8737173cf1f8f
      # or from git:
      git_url: git@github.com:ilanschnell/bsdiff4.git
      git_tag: 1.1.4
      # or from hg:
      hg_url: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ilanschnell/bsdiff4
      hg_tag: 1.1.4
      # or from svn:
      svn_url: https://github.com/ilanschnell/bsdiff
      svn_rev: 1.1.4
      svn_ignore_externals: yes # (defaults to no)

      # Patches may optionally be applied to the source
      patches:
        - my.patch    # the patch file is expected to be found in the recipe

    # Note, the source section is optional. If you want to specify a source
    # location locally, the easiest way is to not specify the source here, but
    # to just add something like
    #
    # cp -r $RECIPE_DIR/../src .
    # cd src
    # ...
    #
    # in build.sh (and similarly in bld.bat). This assumes the source is
    # shipped alongside the recipe in src.

    build:
      # The build number should be incremented for new builds of the same version
      number: 1       # (defaults to 0)
      string: abc     # (defaults to default conda build string plus the build number)

      # Optional Python entry points
      entry_points:
        # This creates an entry point named bsdiff4 that calls bsdiff4.cli.main_bsdiff4()
        - bsdiff4 = bsdiff4.cli:main_bsdiff4
        - bspatch4 = bsdiff4.cli:main_bspatch4

      # If osx_is_app is set, entry points will use python.app instead of python in Mac OS X
      osx_is_app: yes # (defaults to no)

      # Whether binary files should be made relocatable (using
      # install_name_tool on OS X or patchelf on Linux). See the "making
      # packages relocatable" section below for more information on this.
      binary_relocation: false # (defaults to true)

      # See the features section below for more information on features

      # Defines what features a package has
      features:
        - feature1

      # Indicates that installing this package should enable (track) the given
      # features. A package does not need to have a feature to track it.
      track_features:
        - feature2

      # Preserve the Python egg directory. This is needed for some packages
      # that use setuptools specific features.
      preserve_egg_dir: yes # (default no)

      # A regular expression describing files to not install using soft
      # links. If hard links are not possible and this is set, the package
      # will be installed via copying. By default all files are considered
      # safe for soft linking.
      no_softlink: (bin/path1\.py|bin/path2) # Don't softlink bin/path1.py or bin/path2

      # Used instead of build.sh or bld.bat. For short build scripts, this can
      # be more convenient. You may need to use selectors (see below) to use
      # different scripts for different platforms.
      script: python setup.py install

      # Files that should have the placeholder prefix
      # (/opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3) replaced with the install prefix at

      has_prefix_files:
        - bin/file1
        - lib/file2

      # Binary files that should have their build prefix replaced with the
      # install prefix at installation time.  Due to the way this works, the
      # install prefix cannot be longer than the build prefix.  It is
      # recommended to build against a very long prefix. The easiest way to do
      # this is to install miniconda into a very long path.  Future versions
      # of conda build may do this automatically. See also the Relocatable
      # section below.
      binary_has_prefix_files:
        - bin/binaryfile1

      # listed explicitly if they are required.

.. _build-version-spec:

Specifying versions in requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each element in the list of build and run-time requirements is a
match specification, i.e. a string, which (when split by spaces)
has 1, 2 or 3 parts:

* the first part is always the (exact) name
* the second part refers to the version, and may contain special characters

  ``|`` means "or", e.g. ``1.0|1.`` matches either version 1.0 or 1.2

  ``*`` means (in terms of regex) ``r'.*'``

  Example:

  ``1.0|1.4*``  matches 1.0, 1.4, 1.4.1b2, but not 1.2 (when there are 3
  parts, the second part has to be the exact version)

* the third part is always the (exact) build string


Preprocessing selectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition, you can add selectors to any line, which are used as part of a
preprocessing stage. Before the yaml file is read, each selector is evaluated,
and if it is False, the line that it is on is removed.  A selector is of the
form ``# [<selector>]`` at the end of a line.

For example

.. code-block:: yaml

   source:
     url: http://path/to/unix/source    # [not win]
     url: http://path/to/windows/source # [win]

A selector is just a valid Python statement, that is executed.  The following
variables are defined. Unless otherwise stated, the variables are booleans.

.. list-table::

   * - ``linux``
     - True if the platform is Linux
   * - ``linux32``
     - True if the platform is Linux and the Python architecture is 32-bit
   * - ``linux64``
     - True if the platform is Linux and the Python architecture is 64-bit
   * - ``armv6``
     - True if the platform is Linux and the Python architecture is armv6l
   * - ``osx``
     - True if the platform is OS X
   * - ``unix``
     - True if the platform is Unix (OS X or Linux)
   * - ``win``
     - True if the platform is Windows
   * - ``win32``
     - True if the platform is Windows and the Python architecture is 32-bit
   * - ``win64``
     - True if the platform is Windows and the Python architecture is 64-bit
   * - ``py``
     - The Python version as a two digit string (like ``'27'``). See also the
       ``CONDA_PY`` environment variable :ref:`below <build-envs>`.
   * - ``py3k``
     - True if the Python major version is 3
   * - ``py2k``
     - True if the Python major version is 2
   * - ``py26``
     - True if the Python version is 2.6
   * - ``py27``
     - True if the Python version is 2.7
   * - ``py33``
     - True if the Python version is 3.3
   * - ``py34``
     - True if the Python version is 3.4
   * - ``np``
     - The NumPy version as a two digit string (like ``'17'``).  See also the
       ``CONDA_NPY`` environment variable :ref:`below <build-envs>`.

Because the selector is any valid Python expression, complicated logic is
possible.

.. code-block:: yaml

   source:
     url: http://path/to/windows/source      # [win]
     url: http://path/to/python2/unix/source # [unix and py2k]
     url: http://path/to/python3/unix/source # [unix and py3k]

Note that the selectors delete only they line that they are on, so you may
need to put the same selector on multiple lines.

.. code-block:: yaml

   source:
     url: http://path/to/windows/source     # [win]
     md5: 30fbf531409a18a48b1be249052e242a  # [win]
     url: http://path/to/unix/source        # [unix]
     md5: 88510902197cba0d1ab4791e0f41a66e  # [unix]

Environment variables set during the build process
--------------------------------------------------

The following environment variables are set, both on Unix (``build.sh``) and on
Windows (``bld.bat``) during the build process:

.. list-table::

  * - ``ARCH``
    - Either ``32`` or ``64``, to specify whether the build is 32-bit or
      64-bit.  The value depends on the ``ARCH`` environment variable, and
      defaults to the architecture the interpreter running conda was
      compiled with.
  * - ``CONDA_BUILD=1``
    - Always set.
  * - ``SRC_DIR``
    - Path to where source is unpacked (or cloned). If the source file is not
      a recognized file type (right now, ``.zip``, ``.tar``, ``.tar.bz2``,
      ``.tar.xz``, and ``.tar``), this is a directory containing a copy of the
      source file.
  * - ``PREFIX``
    - Build prefix where build script should install to.
  * - ``RECIPE_DIR``
    - Directory of recipe.
  * - ``PKG_NAME``
    - Name of the package being built.
  * - ``PKG_VERSION``
    - Version of the package being built.
  * - ``PKG_BUILDNUM``
    - Build number of the package being built.
  * - ``PATH``
    - Prepended by the build prefix bin directory.
  * - ``PYTHON``
    - Path to python executable in build prefix (note that python is only
      installed in the build prefix when it is listed as a build requirement).
  * - ``PY3K``
    - ``1`` when Python 3 is installed in build prefix, else ``0``.
  * - ``STDLIB_DIR``
    - Python standard library location
  * - ``SP_DIR``
    - Python's site-packages location
  * - ``PY_VER``
    - Python version building against

When building "unix-style" packages on Windows, which are then usually
statically linked to executables, we do this in a special *Library* directory
under the build prefix.  The following environment variables are only
defined in Windows:

.. list-table::

  * - ``LIBRARY_PREFIX``
    - ``<build prefix>\Library``
  * - ``LIBRARY_BIN``
    - ``<build prefix>\Library\bin``
  * - ``LIBRARY_INC``
    - ``<build prefix>\Library\include``
  * - ``LIBRARY_LIB``
    - ``<build prefix>\Library\lib``
  * - ``SCRIPTS``
    - ``<build prefix>\Scripts``

On non-Windows (Linux and Mac OS X), we have:

.. list-table::

  * - ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH``
    - Path to ``pkgconfig`` directory.
  * - ``HOME``
    - Standard ``$HOME`` environment variable.

On Mac OS X, we have:

.. list-table::

  * - ``OSX_ARCH``
    - ``i386`` or ``x86_64``, depending on Python build
  * - ``CFLAGS``
    - ``-arch`` flag.
  * - ``CXXFLAGS``
    - Same as ``CFLAGS``.
  * - ``LDFLAGS``
    - Same as ``CFLAGS``.
  * - ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET``
    - Same as the Anaconda Python. Currently ``10.5``.

On Linux, we have:

.. list-table::

  * - ``LD_RUN_PATH``
    - ``<build prefix>/lib``


All of the above environment variables are also set during the test process,
except with the test prefix instead of the build prefix everywhere.

Note that build.sh is run with ``bash -x -e`` (the ``-x`` makes it echos each
command that is run, and the ``-e`` makes it exit whenever a command in the
script returns nonzero exit status).  You can revert this in the script if you
need to by using the ``set`` command.


.. _build-envs:

Environment variables that affect the build process
---------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - ``CONDA_PY``
     - Should be ``26``, ``27``, ``33``, or ``34``.  This is the Python version
       used to build the package.
   * - ``CONDA_NPY``
     - Should be either ``16`` or ``17``.  This is the NumPy version used to
       build the package.

Pre/Post link/unlink scripts
----------------------------
.. TODO: Add post-unlink

You can add scripts `pre-link.sh`, `post-link.sh`, or `pre-unlink.sh` (or
`.bat` for Windows) to the recipe, which will be run before the package is
installed, after it is installed, and before it is removed, respectively. If
these scripts exit nonzero the installation/removal will fail.

Environment variables are set in these scripts:

.. list-table::

   * - ``PREFIX``
     - The install prefix.
   * - ``PKG_NAME``
     - The name of the package.
   * - ``PKG_VERSION``
     - The version of the package.
   * - ``PKG_BUILDNUM``
     - The build number of the package.

No output is shown from the build script, but it may write to
``$PREFIX/.messages.txt``, which is shown after conda completes all actions.

Post-build version
------------------

In some cases, you may not know the version, build number, or build string of
the package until after it is built. In this case, you can write files named
``__conda_version__.txt``, ``__conda_buildnum__.txt``, or
``__conda_buildstr__.txt`` to the source directory, and the contents of the
file will be used as the version, build number, or build string, respectively
(and the respective metadata from the ``meta.yaml`` will be ignored).

.. _features:

Features
--------

Features are a way to track differences in two packages that have the same
name and version.  For example, a feature might indicate a specialized
compiler or runtime, or a fork of a package. The canonical example of a
feature is the ``mkl`` feature in Anaconda Accelerate. Packages that are
compiled against MKL, such as NumPy, have the ``mkl`` feature set.  The
``mkl`` package has the ``mkl`` feature set in ``track_features``, so that
installing it installs the ``mkl`` feature.

Features should be thought of as features of the environment the package is
installed into, not the package itself. The reason is that when a feature is
installed, conda will automatically change to a package with that feature if
it exists, for instance, when the ``mkl`` feature is installed, regular
``numpy`` is removed and the ``numpy`` package with the ``mkl`` feature is
installed.  Enabling a feature does not install any packages that are not
already installed, but it all future packages with that feature that are
installed into that environment will be preferred.

Feature names are independent of package names---it is a coincidence that
``mkl`` is both the name of a package and the feature that it tracks.

To install a feature, install a package that tracks it. To remove a feature,
use ``conda remove --features``

.. or use conda install --features, blocking on https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/543

.. _relocatable:

Making Packages Relocatable
---------------------------

Often, the most difficult thing about building a conda package is making it
relocatable.  Relocatable means that the package can be installed into any
prefix.  Otherwise, the package would only be usable in the same environment
in which it was built.

Conda build does the following things automatically to make packages relocatable:

- Binary object files are converted to use relative paths using
  ``install_name_tool`` on Mac OS X and ``patchelf`` on Linux.

- The build prefix is replaced in any text (non-binary) file with the prefix
  placeholder, ``/opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3``, and the file is added to
  the ``has_prefix`` file in the package metadata.  When conda installs the
  package, the placeholder prefix is replaced with the install prefix in all
  files in ``info/has_prefix``.  See :ref:`package_metadata` for more
  information.

- You can manually add text files to ``has_prefix`` by listing them in
  ``build/has_prefix_files`` in the meta.yaml (see above).  The files listed
  here should have the placeholder prefix
  (``/opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3``).

- You can manually binary files to ``has_prefix`` by listing them in
  ``build/binary_has_prefix_files`` in the meta.yaml (see above).  The files
  listed here will have their build prefix replaced with the install prefix at
  install time.  This works by padding the build prefix with null terminators,
  so that the length of the binary file remains the same.  Due to this, the
  install prefix must be shorter than the build prefix.  It is recommended to
  build packages with ``binary_has_prefix_files`` in a very long build prefix.
  The easiest way to do this is to install miniconda into a long prefix, such
  as
  ``~/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/very/longprefixminiconda``. Note
  that on Linux, shebang lines longer than 127 characters will not work.
  Future versions of conda-build may do this automatically.
