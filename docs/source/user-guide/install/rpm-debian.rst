RPM and Debian Repositories for Miniconda
-----------------------------------------

Conda is available as either a RedHat RPM or as a Debian package. The packages are the
equivalent to the Miniconda installer, which only contains conda and its dependencies.
You can use yum or apt to install, uninstall, and manage conda on your system. To
install conda, follow the instructions for your Linux distribution.

To install the RPM on RedHat, CentOS, Fedora distributions, and other RPM-based distributions,
such as openSUSE, download the GPG key and add a repository configuration file for conda.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Import our GPG public key
   rpm --import https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/gpgkeys/anaconda.asc

   # Add the Anaconda repository
   cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/conda.repo
   [conda]
   name=Conda
   baseurl=https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/rpmrepo/conda
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/gpgkeys/anaconda.asc
   EOF

Conda is ready to install on your RPM-based distribution.

To install on Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, download the public GPG
key and add the conda repository to the sources list.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install our public GPG key to trusted store
   curl https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/gpgkeys/anaconda.asc | gpg --dearmor > conda.gpg
   install -o root -g root -m 644 conda.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/conda-archive-keyring.gpg

   # Check whether fingerprint is correct (will output an error message otherwise)
   gpg --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/conda-archive-keyring.gpg --no-default-keyring --fingerprint 34161F5BF5EB1D4BFBBB8F0A8AEB4F8B29D82806

   # Add our Debian repo
   echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/conda-archive-keyring.gpg] https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/debrepo/conda stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/conda.list

   **NB:** If you receive a Permission denied error when trying to run the above command (because `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/conda.list` is write protected), try using the following command instead:
   echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/conda-archive-keyring.gpg] https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/misc/debrepo/conda stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/conda.list

Installing conda packages with the system package manager makes it very easy
to distribute conda across a cluster of machines running Linux without having
to worry about any non-privileged user modifying the installation.
Any non-privileged user simply needs to run ``source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`` to use conda.

Administrators can also distribute a .condarc file at /opt/conda/.condarc so that a
predefined configuration for channels, package cache directory, and environment locations
is pre-seeded to all users in a large organization. A sample configuration could look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   channels:
     - defaults
   pkg_dirs:
     - /shared/conda/pkgs
     - $HOME/.conda/pkgs
   envs_dirs:
     - /shared/conda/envs
     - $HOME/.conda/envs

These RPM and Debian packages also provide another way to set up conda inside a Docker container.

.. admonition:: Tip

    It is recommended to use this installation method in a read-only manner and upgrade conda using
    the respective package manager only.
