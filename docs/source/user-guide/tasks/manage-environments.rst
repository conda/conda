=====================
Managing environments
=====================

With conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update
environments that have different versions of Python and/or
packages installed in them. Switching or moving between
environments is called activating the environment. You can also
share an environment file.

There are many options available for the commands described
on this page. For a detailed reference on all available commands,
see :doc:`commands <../../commands/index>`.

Creating an environment with commands
=====================================

Use the terminal for the following steps:

#. To create an environment:

   .. code::

      conda create --name <my-env>

   Replace ``<my-env>`` with the name of your environment.

#. When conda asks you to proceed, type ``y``:

   .. code::

      proceed ([y]/n)?

   This creates the myenv environment in ``/envs/``. No
   packages will be installed in this environment.

#. To create an environment with a specific version of Python:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python=3.9

#. To create an environment with a specific package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv scipy

   or:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python
      conda install -n myenv scipy

#. To create an environment with a specific version of a package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv scipy=0.17.3

   or:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python
      conda install -n myenv scipy=0.17.3

#. To create an environment with a specific version of Python and
   multiple packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python=3.9 scipy=0.17.3 astroid babel

   .. tip::
      Install all the programs that you want in this environment
      at the same time. Installing one program at a time can lead to
      dependency conflicts.

To automatically install pip or another program every time a new
environment is created, add the default programs to the
:ref:`create_default_packages <config-add-default-pkgs>` section
of your ``.condarc`` configuration file. The default packages are
installed every time you create a new environment. If you do not
want the default packages installed in a particular environment,
use the ``--no-default-packages`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create --no-default-packages -n myenv python

.. tip::
   You can add much more to the ``conda create`` command.
   For details, run ``conda create --help``.


.. _create-env-from-file:

Creating an environment from an environment.yml file
====================================================

Use the terminal for the following steps:

#. Create the environment from the ``environment.yml`` file:

   .. code::

      conda env create -f environment.yml

   The first line of the ``yml`` file sets the new environment's
   name. For details see :ref:`Creating an environment file manually
   <create-env-file-manually>`.


#. Activate the new environment: ``conda activate myenv``

#. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

   .. code::

      conda env list

   You can also use ``conda info --envs``.


.. _create-env-from-pyproject:

Creating an environment from a pyproject.toml file
====================================================

Conda can also create environments from specifications in ``pyproject.toml``
files.
To create a new environment from these, also use:

.. code::

      conda env create -f pyproject.toml

For details see :ref:`<pyproject-env-file>`.


.. _specifying-environment-platform:

Specifying a different target platform for an environment
=========================================================

By default, ``conda`` will create environments targeting the platform it's
currently running on. You can check which platform you are currently on by running
``conda info`` and checking the ``platform`` entry.

However, in some cases you might want to create an environment for a
different target platform or architecture. To do so, use the
``--platform`` flag available in the ``conda create`` and
``conda env create`` commands. See ``--subdir, --platform``
in :doc:`/commands/create` for more information about allowed values.

For example, a user running macOS on the Apple Silicon platform
might want to create a ``python`` environment for Intel processors
and emulate the executables with Rosetta. The command would be:

.. code::

   conda create --platform osx-64 --name python-x64 python

.. note::
   You can't specify the ``--platform`` flag for existing environments.
   When created, the environment will be annotated with the custom configuration and
   subsequent operations on it will remember the target platform.

This flag also allows specifying a different OS (e.g. creating a Linux
environment on macOS), but we don't recommend its usage outside of
``--dry-run`` operations. Common problems with mismatched OSes include:

- The environment cannot be solved because virtual packages are missing.
  You can workaround this issue by exporting the necessary
  ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_****`` environment variables. For example, solving
  for Linux from macOS, you will probably need ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_LINUX=1``
  and ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC=2.17``.
- The environment can be solved, but extraction and linking fails due
  filesystem limitations (case insensitive systems, incompatible paths,
  etc). The only workaround here is to use ``--dry-run --json`` to obtain
  the solution and process the payload into a lockfile that can be shared
  with the target machine. See :ref:`dry-run-explicit` for more details.

.. _specifying-location:

Specifying a location for an environment
========================================

You can control where a conda environment lives by providing a path
to a target directory when creating the environment. For example,
the following command will create a new environment in a subdirectory
of the current working directory called ``envs``::

  conda create --prefix ./envs jupyterlab=3.2 matplotlib=3.5 numpy=1.21

You then activate an environment created with a prefix using the same
command used to activate environments created by name::

  conda activate ./envs

Specifying a path to a subdirectory of your project directory when
creating an environment has the following benefits:

* It makes it easy to tell if your project uses an isolated environment
  by including the environment as a subdirectory.
* It makes your project more self-contained as everything, including
  the required software, is contained in a single project directory.

An additional benefit of creating your project’s environment inside a
subdirectory is that you can then use the same name for all your
environments. If you keep all of your environments in your ``envs``
folder, you’ll have to give each environment a different name.

There are a few things to be aware of when placing conda environments
outside of the default ``envs`` folder.

#. Conda can no longer find your environment with the ``--name`` flag.
   You’ll generally need to pass the ``--prefix`` flag along with the
   environment’s full path to find the environment.
#. Specifying an install path when creating your conda environments
   makes it so that your command prompt is now prefixed with the active
   environment’s absolute path rather than the environment’s name.

After activating an environment using its prefix, your prompt will
look similar to the following::

(/absolute/path/to/envs) $

This can result in long prefixes::

(/Users/USER_NAME/research/data-science/PROJECT_NAME/envs) $

To remove this long prefix in your shell prompt, modify the env_prompt
setting in your ``.condarc`` file::

conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'

This will edit your ``.condarc`` file if you already have one
or create a ``.condarc`` file if you do not.

Now your command prompt will display the active environment’s
generic name, which is the name of the environment's root folder:

.. code-block::

  $ cd project-directory
  $ conda activate ./env
  (env) project-directory $

.. _update-env:

Updating an environment
=======================
You may need to update your environment for a variety of reasons.
For example, it may be the case that:

* one of your core dependencies just released a new version
  (dependency version number update).
* you need an additional package for data analysis
  (add a new dependency).
* you have found a better package and no longer need the older
  package (add new dependency and remove old dependency).

If any of these occur, all you need to do is update the contents of
your ``environment.yml`` file accordingly and then run the following
command::

conda env update --file environment.yml  --prune

.. note::
   The ``--prune`` option causes conda to remove any dependencies
   that are no longer required from the environment.


Cloning an environment
======================

Use the terminal for the following steps:

You can make an exact copy of an environment by creating a clone
of it:

.. code::

   conda create --name myclone --clone myenv

.. note::
   Replace ``myclone`` with the name of the new environment.
   Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the existing environment that
   you want to copy.

To verify that the copy was made:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, you should see both the
source environment and the new copy.

.. _identical-conda-envs:

Building identical conda environments
=====================================

You can use explicit specification files to build an identical
conda environment on the same operating system platform, either
on the same machine or on a different machine.

Use the terminal for the following steps:

#. Run ``conda list --explicit`` to produce a spec list such as:

   .. code::

      # This file may be used to create an environment using:
      # $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
      # platform: osx-64
      @EXPLICIT

      https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/free/osx-64/zlib-1.2.8-3.tar.bz2


#. To create this spec list as a file in the current working
   directory, run::

     conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

   .. note::
      You can use ``spec-file.txt`` as the filename or replace
      it with a filename of your choice.

   An explicit spec file is not usually cross platform, and
   therefore has a comment at the top such as ``# platform: osx-64``
   showing the platform where it was created. This platform is the
   one where this spec file is known to work. On other platforms,
   the packages specified might not be available or dependencies
   might be missing for some of the key packages already in the
   spec.

   To use the spec file to create an identical environment on the
   same machine or another machine::

     conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

   To use the spec file to install its listed packages into an
   existing environment::

     conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

   Conda does not check architecture or dependencies when installing
   from a spec file. To ensure that the packages work correctly,
   make sure that the file was created from a working environment,
   and use it on the same architecture, operating system, and
   platform, such as linux-64 or osx-64.


.. _activate-env:

Activating an environment
=========================

Activating environments is essential to making the software in the environments
work well. Activation entails two primary functions: adding entries to PATH for
the environment and running any activation scripts that the environment may
contain. These activation scripts are how packages can set arbitrary
environment variables that may be necessary for their operation. You can also
:ref:`use the config API to set environment variables <set-env-vars>`.

Activation prepends to PATH. This only takes effect
when you have the environment active so it is local to a terminal session,
not global.

.. note::
   When `installing Anaconda <http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install.html>`_,
   you have the option to “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.”
   *This is not recommended* because it *appends* Anaconda to PATH.
   When the installer appends to PATH, it does not call the activation scripts.

.. note::
   On Windows, PATH is composed of two parts, the *system* PATH and the
   *user* PATH. The system PATH always comes first. When you install
   Anaconda for "Just Me", we add it to the *user* PATH. When you install
   for "All Users", we add it to the *system* PATH. In the former case,
   you can end up with system PATH values taking precedence over
   your entries. In the latter case, you do not. *We do not recommend*
   `multi-user installs <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/multi-user/>`__.

To activate an environment: ``conda activate myenv``

.. note::
   Replace ``myenv`` with the environment name or directory path.

Conda prepends the path name ``myenv`` onto your system command.

You may receive a warning message if you have not activated your environment:

.. code-block:: Python

   Warning:
   This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has
   not been activated. Libraries may fail to load. To activate this environment
   please see https://conda.io/activation.

If you receive this warning, you need to activate your environment. To do
so on Windows, run: ``c:\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate base`` in a terminal window.

Windows is extremely sensitive to proper activation. This is because
the Windows library loader does not support the concept of libraries
and executables that know where to search for their dependencies
(RPATH). Instead, Windows relies on a `dynamic-link library search order <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order>`_.

If environments are not active, libraries won't be found and there
will be lots of errors. HTTP or SSL errors are common errors when the
Python in a child environment can't find the necessary OpenSSL library.

Conda itself includes some special workarounds to add its necessary PATH
entries. This makes it so that it can be called without activation or
with any child environment active. In general, calling any executable in
an environment without first activating that environment will likely not work.
For the ability to run executables in activated environments, you may be
interested in the ``conda run`` command.

If you experience errors with PATH, review our :ref:`troubleshooting <path-error>`.

Conda init
----------

Earlier versions of conda introduced scripts to make activation
behavior uniform across operating systems. Conda 4.4 allowed
``conda activate myenv``. Conda 4.6 added extensive initialization
support so that conda works faster and less disruptively on
a wide variety of shells (bash, zsh, csh, fish, xonsh, and more).
Now these shells can use the ``conda activate`` command.
Removing the need to modify PATH makes conda less disruptive to
other software on your system. For more information, read the
output from ``conda init --help``.

One setting may be useful to you when using ``conda init`` is::

  auto_activate_base: bool

This setting controls whether or not conda activates your base
environment when it first starts up. You'll have the ``conda``
command available either way, but without activating the environment,
none of the other programs in the environment will be available until
the environment is activated with ``conda activate base``. People
sometimes choose this setting to speed up the time their shell takes
to start up or to keep conda-installed software from automatically
hiding their other software.

Nested activation
-----------------

By default, ``conda activate`` will deactivate the current environment
before activating the new environment and reactivate it when
deactivating the new environment. Sometimes you may want to leave
the current environment PATH entries in place so that you can continue
to easily access command-line programs from the first environment.
This is most commonly encountered when common command-line utilities
are installed in the base environment. To retain the current environment
in the PATH, you can activate the new environment using::

  conda activate --stack myenv

If you wish to always stack when going from the outermost environment,
which is typically the base environment, you can set the ``auto_stack``
configuration option::

  conda config --set auto_stack 1

You may specify a larger number for a deeper level of automatic stacking,
but this is not recommended since deeper levels of stacking are more likely
to lead to confusion.

Environment variable for DLL loading verification
-------------------------------------------------

If you don't want to activate your environment and you want Python
to work for DLL loading verification, then follow the
:ref:`troubleshooting directions <mkl_library>`.

.. warning::
   If you choose not to activate your environment, then
   loading and setting environment variables to activate
   scripts will not happen. We only support activation.

Deactivating an environment
===========================

To deactivate an environment, type: ``conda deactivate``

Conda removes the path name for the currently active environment from
your system command.

.. note::
   To simply return to the base environment, it's better to call ``conda
   activate`` with no environment specified, rather than to try to deactivate. If
   you run ``conda deactivate`` from your base environment, you may lose the
   ability to run conda at all. Don't worry, that's local to this shell - you can
   start a new one. However, if the environment was activated using ``--stack``
   (or was automatically stacked) then it is better to use ``conda deactivate``.


.. _determine-current-env:

Determining your current environment
====================================

Use the terminal for the following steps.

By default, the active environment---the one you are currently
using---is shown in parentheses () or brackets [] at the
beginning of your command prompt::

  (myenv) $

If you do not see this, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, your current environment
is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

By default, the command prompt is set to show the name of the
active environment. To disable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 false

To re-enable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 true


Viewing a list of your environments
===================================

To see a list of all of your environments, in your terminal window, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

OR

.. code::

   conda env list

A list similar to the following is displayed:

.. code::

   conda environments:
   myenv                 /home/username/miniconda/envs/myenv
   snowflakes            /home/username/miniconda/envs/snowflakes
   bunnies               /home/username/miniconda/envs/bunnies

If this command is run by an administrator, a list of all environments
belonging to all users will be displayed.

Viewing a list of the packages in an environment
================================================

To see a list of all packages installed in a specific environment:

* If the environment is not activated, in your terminal window, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list -n myenv

* If the environment is activated, in your terminal window, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list

* To see if a specific package is installed in an environment, in your
  terminal window, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

    conda list -n myenv scipy


.. _pip-in-env:

Using pip in an environment
===========================

To use pip in your environment, in your terminal window, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -n myenv pip
   conda activate myenv
   pip <pip_subcommand>

Issues may arise when using pip and conda together. When combining conda and pip,
it is best to use an isolated conda environment. Only after conda has been used to
install as many packages as possible should pip be used to install any remaining
software. If modifications are needed to the environment, it is best to create a
new environment rather than running conda after pip. When appropriate, conda and
pip requirements should be stored in text files.

We recommend that you:

**Use pip only after conda**
  - Install as many requirements as possible with conda then use pip.
  - Pip should be run with ``--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed`` (the default).
  - Do not use pip with the ``--user`` argument, avoid all users installs.

**Use conda environments for isolation**
  - Create a conda environment to isolate any changes pip makes.
  - Environments take up little space thanks to hard links.
  - Care should be taken to avoid running pip in the root environment.

**Recreate the environment if changes are needed**
  - Once pip has been used, conda will be unaware of the changes.
  - To install additional conda packages, it is best to recreate
    the environment.

**Store conda and pip requirements in text files**
  - Package requirements can be passed to conda via the ``--file`` argument.
  - Pip accepts a list of Python packages with ``-r`` or ``--requirements``.
  - Conda env will export or create environments based on a file with
    conda and pip requirements.

.. _set-env-vars:

Setting environment variables
=============================

If you want to associate environment variables with an environment,
you can use the config API. This is recommended as an alternative to
using activate and deactivate scripts since those are an execution of
arbitrary code that may not be safe.

First, create your environment and activate it::

  conda create -n test-env
  conda activate test-env

To list any variables you may have, run ``conda env config vars list``.

To set environment variables, run ``conda env config vars set my_var=value``.

Once you have set an environment variable, you have to reactivate your environment:
``conda activate test-env``.

To check if the environment variable has been set, run
``echo $my_var`` (``echo %my_var%`` on Windows)  or ``conda env config vars list``.

When you deactivate your environment, you can use those same commands to see that
the environment variable goes away.

You can specify the environment you want to affect using the ``-n`` and ``-p`` flags. The ``-n`` flag allows you to name the environment and ``-p`` allows you to specify the path to the environment.

To unset the environment variable, run ``conda env config vars unset my_var -n test-env``.

When you deactivate your environment, you can see that environment variable goes away by rerunning
``echo my_var`` or ``conda env config vars list`` to show that the variable name
is no longer present.

Environment variables set using ``conda env config vars`` will be retained in the output of
``conda env export``. Further, you can declare environment variables in the environment.yml file
as shown here::

    name: env-name
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.7
      - codecov
    variables:
      VAR1: valueA
      VAR2: valueB


Saving environment variables
============================

Conda environments can include saved environment variables.

Suppose you want an environment "analytics" to store both a
secret key needed to log in to a server and a path to a
configuration file. The sections below explain how to write a
script named ``env_vars`` to do this on :ref:`Windows
<win-save-env-variables>` and :ref:`macOS or Linux
<macos-linux-save-env-variables>`.

This type of script file can be part of a conda package, in
which case these environment variables become active when an
environment containing that package is activated.

You can name these scripts anything you like. However, multiple
packages may create script files, so be sure to use descriptive
names that are not used by other packages. One popular option is
to give the script a name in the form
``packagename-scriptname.sh``, or on Windows,
``packagename-scriptname.bat``.

.. _win-save-env-variables:

Windows
-------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your
   terminal window by running in the command shell ``%CONDA_PREFIX%``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

    cd %CONDA_PREFIX%
    mkdir .\etc\conda\activate.d
    mkdir .\etc\conda\deactivate.d
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     set MY_FILE=C:\path\to\my\file

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY=
     set MY_FILE=

When you run ``conda activate analytics``, the environment variables
``MY_KEY`` and ``MY_FILE`` are set to the values you wrote into the file.
When you run ``conda deactivate``, those variables are erased.

.. _macos-linux-save-env-variables:

macOS and Linux
---------------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your terminal window by running in the terminal ``echo $CONDA_PREFIX``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

     cd $CONDA_PREFIX
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/activate.d
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/deactivate.d
     touch ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
     touch ./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     export MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     export MY_FILE=/path/to/my/file/

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     unset MY_KEY
     unset MY_FILE

When you run ``conda activate analytics``, the environment
variables ``MY_KEY`` and ``MY_FILE`` are set to the values you wrote into
the file. When you run ``conda deactivate``, those variables are
erased.


Sharing an environment
=======================

You may want to share your environment with someone else---for
example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To
allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its
packages and versions, give them a copy of your
``environment.yml`` file.

Exporting the environment.yml file
----------------------------------

.. note::
   If you already have an ``environment.yml`` file in your
   current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.

#. Activate the environment to export: ``conda activate myenv``

   .. note::
      Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the environment.

#. Export your active environment to a new file::

     conda env export > environment.yml

   .. note::
      This file handles both the environment's pip packages
      and conda packages.

#. Email or copy the exported ``environment.yml`` file to the
   other person.

.. _export-platform:

Exporting an environment file across platforms
----------------------------------------------

If you want to make your environment file work across platforms,
you can use the ``conda env export --from-history`` flag. This
will only include packages that you’ve explicitly asked for,
as opposed to including every package in your environment.

For example, if you create an environment and install Python and a package::

  conda install python=3.7 codecov

This will download and install numerous additional packages to solve
for dependencies. This will introduce packages that may not be compatible
across platforms.

If you use ``conda env export``, it will export all of those packages.
However, if you use ``conda env export --from-history``, it will
only export those you specifically chose:

.. code-block::

   (env-name) ➜  ~ conda env export --from-history
   name: env-name
   channels:
     - conda-forge
     - defaults
   dependencies:
     - python=3.7
     - codecov
   prefix: /Users/username/anaconda3/envs/env-name

.. note::
   If you installed Anaconda 2019.10 on macOS, your prefix may be
   ``/Users/username/opt/envs/env-name``.

.. _create-env-file-manually:

Creating an environment file manually
-------------------------------------

You can create an environment file (``environment.yml``) manually
to share with others.

EXAMPLE: A simple environment file:

.. code::

    name: stats
    dependencies:
      - numpy
      - pandas

EXAMPLE: A more complex environment file:

.. code::

   name: stats2
   channels:
     - javascript
   dependencies:
     - python=3.9
     - bokeh=2.4.2
     - conda-forge::numpy=1.21.*
     - nodejs=16.13.*
     - flask
     - pip
     - pip:
       - Flask-Testing

.. note::
   **Using wildcards**

   Note the use of the wildcard ``*`` when defining a few of the
   versions in the complex environment file. Keeping the major and
   minor versions fixed while allowing the patch to be any number
   allows you to use your environment file to get any bug fixes
   while still maintaining consistency in your environment. For
   more information on package installation values,
   see :doc:`../concepts/pkg-search`.

   **Specifying channels outside of "channels"**

   You may occasionally want to specify which channel conda will
   use to install a specific package. To accomplish this, use the
   `channel::package` syntax in `dependencies:`, as demonstrated
   above with `conda-forge::numpy` (version numbers optional). The
   specified channel does not need to be present in the `channels:`
   list, which is useful if you want some—but not *all*—packages
   installed from a community channel such as `conda-forge`.

You can exclude the default channels by adding ``nodefaults``
to the channels list.

.. code::

   channels:
     - javascript
     - nodefaults

This is equivalent to passing the ``--override-channels`` option
to most ``conda`` commands.

Adding ``nodefaults`` to the channels list in ``environment.yml``
is similar to removing ``defaults`` from the :ref:`channels
list <config-channels>` in the ``.condarc`` file. However,
changing ``environment.yml`` affects only one of your conda
environments while changing ``.condarc`` affects them all.

For details on creating an environment from this
``environment.yml`` file, see :ref:`create-env-from-file`.


.. _pyproject-env-file:

Specifying a conda environment in pyproject.toml
------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to specify conda environments in the ``pyproject.toml``
files that are widely used in the PyPI ecosystem.

For this, the ``pyproject.toml`` file should have a ``[tool.conda.environment]``
table containing the environment specification with the usual structure but in
TOML syntax.
The table can contain any of the same information that ``environment.yml`` can.

For example, the following:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.conda.environment]
   name = "my-project"
   channels = ["defaults"]
   dependencies = ["python", "pandas"]

is installed by conda in exactly the same way as the YAML equivalent:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: my-project
    channels:
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python
      - pandas

Dependencies from the PyPI ecosystem that conda should install using `pip` can
be specified in the normal place:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.conda.environment]
   dependencies = [
     "pip",
     "python",
     {pip = ["httpx"]},
   ]

Alternatively, they can be listed as a `dependency group <https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/>`_
with the key ``conda-pip``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependency-groups]
   conda-pip = ["httpx"]

   [tool.conda.environment]
   dependencies = [
     "python",
   ]

In this case there is no need to list `pip` as a dependency unless a specific
version is required.

This latter approach is useful if you wish to support both Python packaging
ecosystems with one file:
- packages common to both ecosystems can be listed in the ``conda-pip``
  dependency group to be installed by everyone (as they are also picked up by
  `pip`, `poetry`, `uv` etc.)
- conda-only packages can be listed in ``tool.conda.environment.dependencies``
- PyPI-only packages (or PyPI equivalents of conda packages) can be listed in
  any other dependency group or in ``project.dependencies`` as desired - conda
  will ignore these.

The rest of the ``pyproject.toml`` file is ignored, with the one exception that
if ``tool.conda.environment.name`` is missing, ``project.name`` will
be used in its place if present.

At this time, ``pyproject.toml`` support is "read-only" i.e. conda can install
from them but not export to them.


Restoring an environment
========================

Conda keeps a history of all the changes made to your environment,
so you can easily "roll back" to a previous version. To list the history of each change to the current environment:
``conda list --revisions``

To restore environment to a previous revision: ``conda install --revision=REVNUM``
or ``conda install --rev REVNUM``.

.. note::
   Replace REVNUM with the revision number.

Example:
If you want to restore your environment to revision 8, run ``conda install --rev 8``.

Removing an environment
=======================

To remove an environment, in your terminal window, run:

.. code::

   conda remove --name myenv --all

You may instead use ``conda env remove --name myenv``.

To verify that the environment was removed, in your terminal window, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

The environments list that displays should not show the removed
environment.

.. _dry-run-explicit:

Create explicit lockfiles without creating an environment
=========================================================

``@EXPLICIT`` lockfiles allow you to (re)create environments without invoking the solver.
They consist of an ``@EXPLICIT`` header plus a list of conda package URLs, optionally followed
by their MD5 or SHA256 hash.

They can be obtained from existing environments via ``conda list --explicit``, as seen in
:ref:`identical-conda-envs`.

But what if you only need the lockfile? Would you need create to a temporary environment first just
to delete it later? Fortunately, there's a way: you can invoke ``conda`` in JSON mode and then
process the output with ``jq``.

.. tip::

   You'll need ``jq`` in your system. If you don't have it yet, you can install it via
   ``conda`` (e.g. ``conda create -n jq jq``) or via your system package manager.

The command looks like this for Linux and macOS (replace ``MATCHSPECS_GO_HERE`` with the relevant
packages you want):

.. code-block:: shell

   echo "@EXPLICIT" > explicit.txt
   CONDA_PKGS_DIRS=$(mktemp -d) conda create --dry-run MATCHSPECS_GO_HERE --json | jq -r '.actions.FETCH[] | .url + "#" + .md5' >> explicit.txt

The syntax in Windows only needs some small changes:

.. code-block:: shell

   echo "@EXPLICIT" > explicit.txt
   set "CONDA_PKGS_DIRS=%TMP%\conda-%RANDOM%"
   conda create --dry-run MATCHSPECS_GO_HERE --json | jq -r '.actions.FETCH[] | .url + "#" + .md5' >> explicit.txt
   set "CONDA_PKGS_DIRS="

The resulting ``explicit.txt`` can be used to create a new environment with:

.. code::

   conda create -n new-environment --file explicit.txt
