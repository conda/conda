Managing virtual packages
=========================

"Virtual" packages are injected into the conda solver to allow real packages
to depend on features present on the system that cannot be managed directly by
conda, like system driver versions or CPU features. Virtual packages are not
real packages and not displayed by ``conda list``. Instead ``conda`` runs a
small bit of code to detect the presence or absence of the system feature that
corresponds to the package. The currently supported list of virtual packages includes:

  * ``__cuda``: Maximum version of CUDA supported by the display driver.
  * ``__osx``: OSX version if applicable.
  * ``__glibc``: Version of glibc supported by the OS.
  * ``__linux``: Available when running on Linux.
  * ``__unix``: Available when running on OSX or Linux.
  * ``__win``: Available when running on Win.
  * ``__conda``: Version of conda that is being used for solving.

Other virtual packages will be added in future conda releases. These are denoted
by a leading double-underscore in the package name.

.. note::

   Note that as of version ``22.11.0``,
   :doc:`virtual packages <../../dev-guide/plugins/virtual_packages>` are
   implemented as :doc:`conda plugins <../../user-guide/concepts/conda-plugins>`.

Listing detected virtual packages
=================================

Use the terminal for the following steps.

To see the list of detected virtual packages, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda info

If a package is detected, you will see it listed in the ``virtual packages``
section, as shown in this example::

         active environment : base
        active env location : /Users/demo/dev/conda/devenv
                shell level : 1

               offline mode : False


Overriding detected packages
============================

For troubleshooting, it is possible to override virtual package detection
using an environment variable or a setting in your ``.condarc`` file.

Environment variables
---------------------

You can set environment variables when using a ``conda install`` command.
This way of overriding has the highest priority, **but the override
variable must be set every time a package requiring that override is installed**.

**Example**:

.. code-block::

    CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=11.8 conda install pytorch

Supported variables include:

.. csv-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    "Variable Name", "Override Entity", "Example"
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_ARCHSPEC``", Build Number", x86_64
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA``", "Version Number", 10.1
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC``", "Version Number",
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_LINUX``", Version Number,
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_OSX``", Version Number,
    "``CONDA_OVERRIDE_WINDOWS``", Version Number,

.. note::

    For any custom virtual packages, the variable name is
    ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_<NAME>`` and the override entity is the
    ``override_entity`` variable value, either "version" or "build".

``.condarc`` setting
--------------------

To avoid having to set any override variables every time you install a package,
conda also offers the ability to set these overrides in your ``.condarc`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    override_virtual_packages:
      archspec: "x86_64"
      cuda: "11.8"
      glibc: ""
      linux: ""
      osx: ""
      windows: ""
      mycustompackage: "1.2.3"

See `<override_virtual_packages> override-virtual-packages` for more information on
the ``.condarc`` setting.
