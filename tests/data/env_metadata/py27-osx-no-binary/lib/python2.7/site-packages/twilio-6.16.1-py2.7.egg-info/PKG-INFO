        A module for using the Twilio REST API and generating valid
        `TwiML <http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/>`__.
        
        Recent Update
        -------------
        
        As of release 6.5.0, Beta and Developer Preview products are now exposed
        via the main ``twilio-python`` artifact. Releases of the ``alpha``
        branch have been discontinued.
        
        If you were using the ``alpha`` release line, you should be able to
        switch back to the normal release line without issue.
        
        If you were using the normal release line, you should now see several
        new product lines that were historically hidden from you due to their
        Beta or Developer Preview status. Such products are explicitly
        documented as Beta/Developer Preview both in the Twilio docs and
        console, as well as through in-line code documentation here in the
        library.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from PyPi using
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__, a package manager for
        Python.
        
        ::
        
           pip install twilio
        
        Don't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the
        command line:
        
        ::
        
           $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python
        
        Or, you can `download the source code
        (ZIP) <https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python/zipball/master>`__ for
        ``twilio-python``, and then run:
        
        ::
        
           python setup.py install
        
        You may need to run the above commands with ``sudo``.

        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Getting started with the Twilio API couldn't be easier. Create a
        ``Client`` and you're ready to go.
        
        API Credentials
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``Twilio`` needs your Twilio credentials. You can either pass these
        directly to the constructor (see the code below) or via environment
        variables.
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from twilio.rest import Client
        
           account = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
           client = Client(account, token)
        
        Alternately, a ``Client`` constructor without these parameters will look
        for ``TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`` and ``TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`` variables inside
        the current environment.
        
        We suggest storing your credentials as environment variables. Why?
        You'll never have to worry about committing your credentials and
        accidentally posting them somewhere public.
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from twilio.rest import Client
           client = Client()
        
        Make a Call
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from twilio.rest import Client
        
           account = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
           client = Client(account, token)
        
           call = client.calls.create(to="9991231234",
                                      from_="9991231234",
                                      url="http://twimlets.com/holdmusic?Bucket=com.twilio.music.ambient")
           print(call.sid)
        
        Send an SMS
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from twilio.rest import Client
        
           account = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           token = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
           client = Client(account, token)
        
           message = client.messages.create(to="+12316851234", from_="+15555555555",
                                            body="Hello there!")
        
        Handling a call using TwiML
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To control phone calls, your application needs to output
        `TwiML <http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/>`__. Use
        ``twilio.twiml.Response`` to easily create such responses.
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse
        
           r = VoiceResponse()
           r.say("Welcome to twilio!")
           print(str(r))
        
        .. code:: xml
        
           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
           <Response><Say>Welcome to twilio!</Say></Response>
        
        Docker Image
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The `Dockerfile` present in this repository and its respective `twilio/twilio-python` Docker image are currently used by Twilio for testing purposes only.
