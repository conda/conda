    Unlike curses, this doesn't require clearing the screen before doing
    anything, and it's friendlier to use. It keeps the endless calls to
    ``tigetstr()`` and ``tparm()`` out of your code, and it acts intelligently
    when somebody pipes your output to a non-terminal.

    Instance attributes:

      ``stream``
        The stream the terminal outputs to. It's convenient to pass the stream
        around with the terminal; it's almost always needed when the terminal
        is and saves sticking lots of extra args on client functions in
        practice.

    """

        If ``stream`` is not a tty, I will default to returning an empty
        Unicode string for all capability values, so things like piping your
        output to a file won't strew escape sequences all over the place. The
        ``ls`` command sets a precedent for this: it defaults to columnar
        output when being sent to a tty and one-item-per-line when not.

        :arg kind: A terminal string as taken by ``setupterm()``. Defaults to
            the value of the ``TERM`` environment variable.
        :arg stream: A file-like object representing the terminal. Defaults to
            the original value of stdout, like ``curses.initscr()`` does.
        :arg force_styling: Whether to force the emission of capabilities, even
            if we don't seem to be in a terminal. This comes in handy if users
            are trying to pipe your output through something like ``less -r``,
            which supports terminal codes just fine but doesn't appear itself
            to be a terminal. Just expose a command-line option, and set
            ``force_styling`` based on it. Terminal initialization sequences
            will be sent to ``stream`` if it has a file descriptor and to
            ``sys.__stdout__`` otherwise. (``setupterm()`` demands to send them
            somewhere, and stdout is probably where the output is ultimately
            headed. If not, stderr is probably bound to the same terminal.)
