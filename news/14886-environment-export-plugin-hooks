### Enhancements

* Enhanced `conda export` command now supports plugin-based architecture with multiple output formats:
  - `environment-yaml` (cross-platform YAML, default format)
  - `environment-json` (cross-platform JSON for programmatic use)
  - `explicit` (CEP 23 compliant explicit URLs for exact reproduction)
  - `requirements` (MatchSpec-based requirements format) (#14886)
* New automatic format detection based on filename patterns (e.g., `environment.yaml`, `explicit.txt`, `requirements.txt`) (#14886)
* New format aliases for convenience (`yaml`, `yml`, `json`, `reqs`, `txt`) (#14886)

### Bug fixes

* Fix `conda export --override-channels` behavior to properly include installed packages' channels (unless `--ignore-channels` is also provided), restoring the original intended functionality and improving environment reproducibility. (#15048 via #14886)
