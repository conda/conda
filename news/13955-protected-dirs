### Enhancements

* <news item>

### Bug fixes

* Prevent directories which contain conda environments from being specified as an environment prefix when creating new envs; this provides guardrails against the accidental deletion of environments via commands such as `conda rename`. (#13955)

### Deprecations

* Mark `conda/cli/main_rename/validate_destination` as pending deprecation. Use `conda.cli.install.validate_new_prefix` instead. (#13955)
