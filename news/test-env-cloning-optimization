### Enhancements

* Add test environment cloning optimization with `TemplateEnvManager` for the `tmp_env` fixture. The manager creates template environments on demand for different Python versions (3.10-3.13) and package combinations, caching them for reuse across tests. Supports "clone + install delta" strategy where a Python template is cloned and additional packages installed on top. Uses platform-specific fast copy methods: APFS copy-on-write on macOS (~1.8s), reflinks on Linux (btrfs/xfs), and robocopy on Windows. Expected to benefit 20-30 tests that create Python environments.
