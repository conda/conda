### Enhancements

* Add test environment cloning optimization with `TemplateEnvManager` for the `tmp_env` fixture. The manager creates template environments on demand for different Python versions (3.10-3.13) and package combinations, caching them for reuse across tests. Supports "clone + install delta" strategy where a Python template is cloned and additional packages installed on top. Uses `conda create --clone` for proper prefix replacement in scripts and metadata files (~2s vs ~10s for conda create). Expected to benefit 20-30 tests that create Python environments. (#15677)
