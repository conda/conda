        Because processing new bug reports is time-consuming, we would like to ask you to fill out the following form to the best of your ability and as completely as possible.

        > **Note**
        > Bug reports that are incomplete or missing information may be closed as inactionable.

        Since there are already a lot of open issues, please also take a moment to search existing ones to see if your bug has already been reported. If you find something related, please upvote that issue and provide additional details as necessary.

        💐 Thank you for helping to make Conda better. We would be unable to improve Conda without our community!
