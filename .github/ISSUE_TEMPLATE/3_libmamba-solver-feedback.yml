        Thanks for helping conda! 🐍

        You are trying out a new feature. If you are encountering blocking issues we
        first suggest removing the new solver by typing the following code into your
        terminal:

        ```bash
        $ conda remove conda-libmamba-solver
        ```

        Going through bugs and issues takes up a lot of time, so please be so kind and take a few
        minutes to fill out all the areas to the best of your ability.

        There will always be more issues than there is time to do them, and so we will need to
        selectively close issues that don't provide enough information, so we can focus our time
        on helping people like you who fill out the issue form completely. Thank you for your
        collaboration!

        There are also already a lot of open issues, so please take 2 minutes and search through
        existing ones to see if what you are experiencing already exists

        Thanks for helping conda be amazing. We are nothing without people like you helping build
        a better community 💐!
