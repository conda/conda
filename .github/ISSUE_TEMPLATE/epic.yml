        This form is intended for grouping and collecting together related tickets to better gauge the scope of a problem/feature.

        If you are attempting to report a bug, propose a new feature, or some other code change please use one of the other forms available.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Epics that are incomplete or missing information may be closed as inactionable.

        Since there are already a lot of open issues, please also take a moment to search existing ones to see if a similar epic has already been opened. If you find something related, please upvote that issue and provide additional details as necessary.

        💐 Thank you for helping to make Conda better. We would be unable to improve Conda without our community!
