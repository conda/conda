        Because processing new feature requests is time-consuming, we would like to ask you to fill out the following form to the best of your ability and as completely as possible.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Feature requests that are incomplete or missing information may be closed as inactionable.

        Since there are already a lot of open issues, please also take a moment to search existing ones to see if your feature request has already been submitted. If you find something related, please upvote that issue and provide additional details as necessary.

        üíê Thank you for helping to make `conda/conda` better. We would be unable to improve `conda/conda` without our community!
