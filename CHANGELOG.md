## 24.9.0 (2024-09-26)


### ✨ Special announcement ✨

This is an announcement about an important and positive **future** change in conda's functionality:

Following feedback from conda users about the pre-configuration of the conda code base to favor channels from Anaconda Inc, we've [started the process to deprecate](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/14178) hardcoding Anaconda's channels as the default set of channels in the conda source code, which is a remnant of conda's incubation at the company.

In the future, we will rely on providers of conda distributions, such as [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or Anaconda (including miniconda), to pre-configure their preferred channels, e.g. by running the necessary ``conda config --set channels`` command.

We're also going to continue to [work on improving channel management](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/14217) in the forseeable future and would love to get your feedback.

### Enhancements

* Add `conda.core.index.Index` as a faster drop-in replacement of the realized dictionary index. Note: The loggers are no longer implicitly initialized when fetching the index. Instead, you must explicitly call `conda.gateways.logging.initialize_logging`. (#13880, #14267)
* Alias `conda env remove` command to `conda remove --all`. (#13977)
* Add a new health check to `conda doctor` that detects if the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` env var points to a non-existent file. (#12905 via #14037)
* Add `--sha256` flag to `conda list --explicit` so it lists URLs with a SHA256 hash instead of MD5 and make `conda install|create` compatible with these inputs. (#2903, #7882 via #14048)
* Report `conda` version used to generate a `@EXPLICIT` text file. (#14048)
* Update health checks outputs for consistency. (#14049 via #14079)
* Fix Windows to Unix path conversion to handle UNC mounts and root paths. (#14157)
* Add a new `denylist_channels` config option and `CONDA_DENYLIST_CHANNELS` environment variable to explicitly deny using specific channels globally, which is complementing the already existing `allowlist_channels` config option. (#14176 via #14196)
* Add `conda commands` subcommand. (#14215)
* Add `conda.testing.fixtures.session_capsys`. Use this to capture stdout and stderr within module, package, and session scoped fixtures. (#14243)
* Add `conda.testing.fixtures.session_conda_cli`. Use this to invoke conda commands within module, package, and session scoped fixtures. (#14243)
* Add `conda.testing.fixtures.session_tmp_env`. Use this to create a conda environment within module, package, and session scoped fixtures. (#14243)

### Bug fixes

* Prevent directories that contain conda environments from being specified as an environment prefix when creating new envs; this provides guardrails against the accidental deletion of environments via commands such as `conda rename`. (#13955)
* Enable `conda doctor` to check whether the environment exists or not before trying to generate a health report. (#14042 via #14112)
* Fix `conda.common.configuration.ObjectParameter`'s ability to appropriately handle defaults. (#14148 via #14149)
* `conda remove [env] --all` command no longer deletes empty parent directories for environments that are removed. (#14173)
* Raise an error when attempting to remove non-existent environment. (#14174 via #14199)
* Add pre-/post-command hooks to activation subcommands (`activate`, `deactivate`, `reactivate`, `hooks`, and `commands`). (#14211 via #14212)
* Replace extensions from end of filename only, not `str.replace()`, in two places. (#14241)
* Fix PowerShell activation/deactivation to properly unset environment variables using `$Env:VARIABLE = $null` instead of `$Env:VARIABLE = ""`. (#14237 via #14246)

## 24.7.1 (2024-07-24)

### Bug fixes

* Revert potential regression introduced in #13975. The previously forbidden characters (`^`, `%`, `!`, `=`, `(`, `)`, `\`) are allowed again until the impact is assessed. (#14065)

### Contributors

* @jaimergp



## 24.7.0 (2024-07-17)

### Enhancements

* Add a new `reporters` setting for configuring output. (#13736)
* Report traceback of plugin loading errors with verbosity 2 or higher (`-vv` or more). (#13742 via #13846)
* Skip checking for `.pyc` and `.pyo` files in the `conda doctor` "missing files" health check. (#13370 via #13931)
* **Breaking change**  `conda list --explicit` will not print authentication details by default. A new flag `--auth` has been added so folks can opt-in to this behaviour. (#13936)
* Print transaction report for `@EXPLICIT` lockfile installs too. (#13940)
* Do not require `-n/--name` or `-p/--prefix` if `conda create` is invoked with `--dry-run`. (#13941)
* Add an `envvars_force_uppercase` setting which defaults to `True`, uppercasing all environment variables (thereby justifying `conda`'s current behaviour); when `envvars_force_uppercase` is set to `False`, conda will only save preserved-case variable names. (#13713 via #13943)
* Alias `conda env list` command to `conda info --envs`. (#13972)

### Bug fixes

* Disallow some more characters in Windows for prefix names (`^`, `%`, `!`, `=`, `(`, `)`, `\`). These characters complicate or prevent environment activation if present. (#12558 via #13975)
* Fix caching when `repodata.json` contains `\r\n` line endings. (#14002 via #14003)
* Fix `conda.core.portability.binary_replace` not matching chunks that end with `\n`. (#14043 via #14044)

## 24.1.0 (2024-01-24)

### Special announcement

#### The `conda_env.*` modules have been merged into the `conda` package!

To improve the integration of the `conda env` subcommand (previously standalone), we've moved its
code into the `conda` package, while allowing old `conda env` commands to still work via Python
import redirects. This is a first step of many to improving the user experience of the conda
command line interface related to environment management. (#13168)

### Enhancements

* Verify signatures on to-be-installed packages instead of on all packages. (#11545, #13053)
* Add new `pre-solves` and `post-solves` plugin hooks. (#13053)
* Add support for Python 3.12. (#13072)
* Check `repodata.json.zst` for faster repodata downloads. (#13256)
* Add `--skip-flexible-search` option in `conda search` to skip flexible search. (#13315)
* Provide a more useful warning when attempting to rename a non-existent prefix. (#13387)
* Add a new flag `--keep-env` to be used with `conda remove --all`. It allows users to delete all packages in the environment while retaining the environment itself. (#13419)
* Add a Y/N prompt warning users that `conda env remove` and `conda remove --all` deletes not only the conda packages but the entirety of the specified environment. (#13440)
* Add `--repodata-use-zst/--no-repodata-use-zst` flag to control `repodata.json.zst` check; corresponding `repodata_use_zst: true/false` for `.condarc`. Default is to check for `repodata.json.zst`. Disable if remote returns unparseable `repodata.json.zst` instead of correct data or 404. (#13504)


### Bug fixes

* Create the `~/.conda` directory before trying to write to the `environments.txt` file. (#13338)
* Ensure `PackageRecord.timestamp` is dumped in milliseconds. (#13483)
* Fix error when setting a non-default repodata filename via `CONDA_REPODATA_FNS`. (#13490)
* Fix the config file location where the integrated Anaconda client gateway loads user configuration from. This is a regression introduced in conda 23.11.0 when the `platformdirs` library was adopted. (#13517 via #13520)
* Interpret missing `Cache-Control` header as `max-age=0` instead of exception. (#13522)

## 23.11.0 (2023-11-30)

### Special announcement

New [`menuinst` v2](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/releases/tag/2.0.0) support!

`conda` has supported Start menu items on Windows for a long time. This is what allows users to open up their Miniconda prompt on CMD (Command Prompt) with an initialized `conda` session. This menu item (or shortcut) creation logic is provided by the `menuinst` package.

With the release of 23.11.0, `conda` now supports [`menuinst` v2](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/releases/tag/2.0.0), which enables the same experience across Windows, Linux, and macOS. This means package builders will be able to provide desktop icons across all operating systems, which can be especially useful for GUI applications. See the [documentation](https://conda.github.io/menuinst/) for more details.

If you don't want `conda` to create shortcuts, you can disable it via:

- `shortcuts: false` entry in your `.condarc` configuration
- `CONDA_SHORTCUTS=false` environment variable
- `--no-shortcuts` command-line flag


### Enhancements

* Add support for `menuinst` v2, enabling shortcuts across all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) using a new JSON schema (see [CEP-11](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-11.md)). Retain support for old v1-style JSON menus. (#11882)
* Stop using vendored `chardet` package by `requests`/`pip`; explicitly depend on `charset_normalizer`. (#13171)
* Introduce a new plugin hook, `CondaHealthCheck`, as part of `conda doctor`. (#13186)
* Include `activate` and `deactivate` in the `--help` command list. (#13191)
* Prioritize download of larger packages to prevent smaller ones from waiting. (#13248)
* Display the used solver in `conda info` output for debugging purposes. (#13265)
* Add `__conda` virtual package. (#13266)
* Switch from `appdirs` to `platformdirs`. (#13306)
* Implement resume capability for interrupted package downloads. (#8695)

### Bug fixes

* Log expected JLAP range-request errors at `info` level, occurring when the remote file has rolled over. (#12913)
* Fix a bug causing an error when options like `--debug` are used without specifying a command. (#13232)
* Improve CTRL-C (cancellation) handling for parallel download threads. (#13234)
* Allow overriding of `CONDA_FETCH_THREADS`/`fetch_threads` to set parallel package downloads beyond the default `5`. (#13263)
* Require `requests >=2.28` for enhanced `response.json()` exception handling. (#13346)
* Apply `callback=reset_context` in `conda.plan` to resolve `conda-build` + `conda-libmamba-solver` incompatibilities. ([conda-libmamba-solver#393](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/393) and [conda-libmamba-solver#386](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/386) via #13357)

### Deprecations

* Deprecate `conda.plugins.subcommands.doctor.health_checks.display_health_checks` function. (#13186)
* Deprecate `conda.plugins.subcommands.doctor.health_checks.display_report_heading` function. (#13186)
* Remove `ruamel_yaml` fallback; use `ruamel.yaml` exclusively. (#13218)
* Deprecate `conda.gateways.anaconda_client.EnvAppDirs` in favor of `platformdirs`. (#13306)
* Mark `conda._vendor.cpuinfo` for pending deprecation. (#13313)
* Deprecate `conda._vendor.distro` in favor of the `distro` package. (#13317)

### Docs

* Add the `conda-sphinx-theme` to the conda documentation. (#13298)
* Update specific pages to remove redundant TOC entries. (#13298)
* Include instructions on updating `conda` in the main `README.md`. (#13343)

### Other

* Add a lighter weight s3 test; update embedded test package index. (#13085)
* Refactor code to use lazy imports for all relative imports in `conda.cli.main_*`, and separate argparse configuration functions from `conda.cli.conda_argparse` to their respective `conda.cli.main_*` modules. (#13173)
* Move custom `argparse.Actions` to `conda.cli.actions` (e.g., `NullCountAction`), and relocate helper argparse functions to `conda.cli.helpers` (e.g., `add_parser_prefix`). (#13173)
* Update upper bound for `ruamel.yaml` to `<0.19` following the release of `0.18`. (#13258)
* Replace `black` with `ruff format` in pre-commit. (#13272)

## 23.10.0 (2023-10-30)

### ✨ Special announcement ✨

This is an announcement about an important change in conda's functionality:

#### **With this 23.10.0 release we are changing the default solver of conda to [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/)!** 🥳 🚀

The previously "classic" solver is based on [pycosat](https://github.com/conda/pycosat)/[Picosat](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) and will remain part of conda for the foreseeable future, a fallback is possible and available.

#### Why are we switching the solver?

In short: to make conda faster and more accurate.

A "solver" is the core component of most package managers; it calculates which dependencies (and which version of those dependencies) to install when a user requests to install a package from a package repository. To address growth-related challenges within the conda ecosystem, the conda maintainers, alongside partners Anaconda, Quansight and QuantStack, introduced [a new conda dependency solver based on the Mamba project](https://mamba.readthedocs.io) in December 2022.

Since July 2023, the [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver) plugin has been included in all major conda ecosystem installers (miniforge, miniconda, mambaforge and Anaconda Distribution), but was disabled by default. As soon as these installers are updated to contain conda 23.10.0 or later, they will automatically default to using the conda-libmamba-solver plugin.

#### What can I do if this update doesn't work for me?

If the new solver is not working as you expect:

- Check if the behavior you are observing is a [known issue](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/283) or a [deliberate change](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/libmamba-vs-classic/#intentional-deviations-from-classic).
- If that's not the case, please consider submitting a bug report or feature request in the [conda-libmamba-solver repository](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver/issues/new/choose).
- If necessary, you can go back to using the `classic` solver without modifying your conda installation:
  - When possible, pass the command line option `--solver=classic` to your `conda` calls.
  - Otherwise (e.g. for `conda build ...` or `constructor ...`), set the environment variable `CONDA_SOLVER=classic`.
  - For permanent changes, use the conda configuration system: `conda config --set solver classic`.

#### Where can I learn more about conda-libmamba-solver?

The documentation of the `conda-libmamba-solver` plugin can be found on [conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/).

For more information about the `conda-libmamba-solver` rollout plan, please also see our [blog post from earlier this year](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-05-conda-libmamba-solver-rollout).

### Enhancements

* Provide `--platform` and `--subdir` flags to create environments for non-native platforms, remembering that choice in future operations. (#11505 via #11794)
* IMPORTANT: Set `solver: libmamba` as the new default solver. (#12984)

### Bug fixes

* Check name of symlink, not its target against valid configuration file names (`condarc`, `.condarc`, or `*.yml/yaml`). (#12956)
* Have `conda doctor` ignore blank lines in `~/.conda/environments.txt`. (#12984)

## 23.9.0 (2023-09-27)

### Special announcement

This is an announcement about an important and positive future change in conda's functionality:

> We will change the default solver of conda to [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/) in a __special 23.10.0 release__ in the near future!

You can already benefit from it _today_ by [configuring your conda installation to use it](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/getting-started/#usage) (e.g. by running `conda config --set solver libmamba`).

The current "classic" solver is based on [pycosat](https://github.com/conda/pycosat)/[Picosat](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) and will remain part of conda for the foreseeable future, a fallback is possible and available (see below).

#### Plan to change the default solver

Here is our updated plan to change the default solver, to better follow [CEP 8](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-8.md) and reduce the potential impact on conda users:

- The upcoming, special 23.10.0 release will be dedicated to the switch of the default solver to `libmamba`.
- Users will be able to opt out of the `libmamba` solver and use the `classic` solver instead, by using one of these options:
  - the `--solver=classic` command line option,
  - the `CONDA_SOLVER=classic` environment variable or
  - running `conda config --set solver classic`.
- All development of `conda-libmamba-solver` plugin happens in the [conda-libmamba-solver repo](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver), including issue tracking.
- The documentation of the `conda-libmamba-solver` plugin can be found on [conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/).

For more information about the `conda-libmamba-solver` rollout plan, please also see our [blog post from earlier this year](https://conda.org/blog/2023-07-05-conda-libmamba-solver-rollout).

#### Context

A "solver" is the core component of most package managers; it calculates which dependencies (and which version of those dependencies) to install when a user requests to install a package from a package repository. To address growth-related challenges within the conda ecosystem, the conda maintainers, alongside partners Anaconda, Quansight and QuantStack, introduced [a new conda dependency solver based on the Mamba project](https://mamba.readthedocs.io) in December 2022.

Since July 2023, that [`conda-libmamba-solver`](https://github.com/conda/conda-libmamba-solver) plugin has been included in and automatically installed with all major conda ecosystem installers (miniforge, miniconda, mambaforge and Anaconda Distribution), _with the default solver configuration unchanged_.

### Enhancements

* Improve speed of `fish` shell initialization. (#12811)
* Directly suppress use of binstar (conda) token when fetching trust metadata. (#12889)
* Add a new "auth handler" plugin hook for conda. (#12911)
* Lock index cache metadata by default. Added `--no-lock` option in case of
  problems, should not be necessary. Older `--experimental=lock` no longer has
  an effect. (#12920)
* Add `context.register_envs` option to control whether to register environments
  in `~/.conda/environments.txt` when they are created. Defaults to true. (#12924)
* Inject a new detailed output verbosity level (i.e., the old debug level `-vv` is now `-vvv`). (#12985, #12977, #12420, #13036)
* Add support for `truststore` to the `ssl_verify` config option, enabling conda to use the operating system certificate store (requires Python 3.10 or later). (#13075 and #13149)
* Add `emscripten-wasm32` and `wasi-wasm32` platforms to known platforms. (#13095)
* Adds the `py.typed` marker file to the `conda` package for compliance with PEP-561. (#13107)
* Import `boto3` only when S3 channels are used, saving startup time. (#12914)

### Bug fixes

* When using pip dependencies with `conda env create`, check the directory permissions before writing to disk. (#11610)
* Hide `InsecureRequestWarning` for JLAP when `CONDA_SSL_VERIFY=false`, matching
  non-JLAP behavior. (#12731)
* Disallow ability to create a conda environment with a colon in the prefix. (#13044)
* Fix `AttributeError` logging response with nonexistent request when using JLAP
  with `file:///` URIs. (#12966)
* Do not show progress bars in non-interactive runs for cleaner logs. (#12982)
* Fix S3 bucket name. (#12989)
* Default `--json` and `--debug` to `NULL` so as to not override `CONDA_JSON` and `CONDA_DEBUG` environment variables. (#12987)
* ``XonshActivator`` now uses ``source-bash`` in non-interactive mode to avoid
  side-effects from interactively loaded RC files. (#13012)
* Fix `conda remove --all --json` output. (#13019)
* Update test data to stop triggering security scanners' false-positives. (#13034)
* Fix performance regression of basic commands (e.g., `conda info`) on WSL. (#13035)
* Configure conda to ignore "Retry-After" header to avoid the scenarios when this value is very large and causes conda to hang indefinitely. (#13050)
* Treat `JSONDecodeError` on `repodata.info.json` as a warning, equivalent to a
  missing `repodata.info.json`. (#13056)
* Fix sorting error for `conda config --show-sources --json`. (#13076)
* Catch `OSError` in `find_commands` to account for incorrect `PATH` entries on
  Windows. (#13125)
* Catch a `NotWritableError` when trying to find the first writable package cache dir. (#9609)
* `conda env update --prune` uses only the specs coming from `environment.yml` file and ignores the history specs. (#9614)

### Contributors

* @jezdez
* @kenodegard



## 23.7.0 (2023-07-25)

### Enhancements

* Add `conda.deprecations.DeprecationHandler.action` helper to deprecate `argparse.Action`s. (#12493)
* Add support for the FreeBSD operating system and register `freebsd-64` as a known subdirectory for FreeBSD on x86-64. (#12647)
* Do not mock `$CONDA_PREFIX` when `--name` or `--prefix` is provided. (#12696)
* Add support for `sha256` filters in the MatchSpec syntax (e.g. `*[sha256=f453db4ffe2271ec492a2913af4e61d4a6c118201f07de757df0eff769b65d2e]`). (#12654 via #12707)
* Add a new health check to `conda doctor` detecting altered packages in an environment by comparing expected and computed `sha256` checksums. (#12757)
* Add new `pre_commands` and `post_commands` plugin hooks allowing plugins to run code before and after `conda` subcommands. (#12712, #12758, #12864)
* Stop using `distutils` directly in favor of the vendored version in `setuptools` 60 and later or standard library equivalents. (#11136)
* Add a `CITATION.cff` file to the root of the repository to make it easier for users to cite conda. (#12781)
* Add optional `CondaSubcommand.configure_parser` allowing third-party plugins to hook into conda's argument parser. (#12814)
* Only display third-party subcommands in `conda --help` and not for every other subcommand. (#12814, #12740)
* Add a new config option, `no_plugins`, a` --no-plugins` command line flag, and a `CONDA_NO_PLUGINS` environment variable that disables external plugins for built-in conda commands. (#12748)
* Register plugins using their canonical/fully-qualified name instead of the easily spoofable entry point name. (#12869)
* De-duplicate plugin and legacy subcommands in `conda --help`. (#12893)
* Implement a 2-phase parser to better handle plugin disabling (via `--no-plugins`). (#12910)
* Refactor subcommand parsing to use a greedy parser since `argparse.REMAINDER` has [known issues](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/61252). (#12910)

### Bug fixes

* Use `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` for ensuring compatibility with different `json` implementations used by requests. This fixes a bug that caused only the first of multiple given source URLs to be tried. This also raises the minimum required requests version to 2.27.0. (#12683)
* Don't export `__osx` virtual package when `CONDA_OVERRIDE_OSX=""`. (#12715)
* Fix erroneous `conda deactivate` behavior of unsetting preexisting environment variables that are identical to those set during `conda activate`. (#12769)
* Correct third-party subcommands to receive _remaining_ arguments instead of a blanket `sys.argv[2:]` which broke `conda_cli` testing. (#12814, #12910)

### Contributors

* @kenodegard



## 23.5.1 (2023-07-12)

### Bug fixes

* Add (back) the `cygpath` fallback logic since `cygpath` is not always available on Windows. (#12873)

### Contributors

* @kenodegard



## 23.5.0 (2023-05-17)

### Enhancements

* Add `conda doctor` subcommand plugin. (#474)
* Add Python 3.11 support. (#12256)
* Add `conda list --reverse` to return a reversed list of installed packages. (#11954)
* Switch from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml` and use [Hatchling](https://pypi.org/project/hatchling/) for our build system. (#12509)
* Optimize which Python modules get imported during `conda activate` calls to make it faster. (#12550)
* Add `conda_cli` fixture to replace `conda.testing.helpers.run_inprocess_conda_command` and `conda.testing.integration.run_command`. (#12592)
* Add `tmp_env` fixture to replace `conda.testing.integration.make_temp_env`. (#12592)
* Add `path_factory` fixture to replace custom prefix logic like `conda.testing.integration._get_temp_prefix` and `conda.testing.integration.make_temp_prefix`. (#12592)
* Refactor the way that the `Activator` classes are defined in `conda/activate.py`. (#12627)
* Warn about misconfiguration when signature verification is enabled. (#12639)

### Bug fixes

* `conda clean` no longer fails if we failed to get the file stats. (#12536)
* Provide fallback version if `conda.deprecations.DeprecationHandler` receives a bad version. (#12541)
* Ensure the default value for `defaults` includes `msys2` when `context.subdir` is `win-*` on non-Windows platforms. (#12555)
* Avoid `TypeError` when non-string types are written to the index cache metadata. (#12562)
* `conda.core.package_cache_data.UrlsData.get_url` no longer fails when `package_path` has `.conda` extension. (#12516)
* Stop pre-converting paths to Unix style on Windows in `conda.sh`, so that they are prefix replaceable upon installation, which got broken by #12509. It also relies on `cygpath` at runtime, which all `msys2`/`cygwin` bash versions on Windows should have available. (#12627)

* Prevent double solve attempt if `PackagesNotFoundError` is raised. (#12201)
* Virtual packages follow `context.subdir` instead of `platform.system()` to enable cross-platform installations. (#12219)
* Don't export `__glibc` virtual package when `CONDA_OVERRIDE_GLIBC=""`. (#12267)
* Fix `arg_parse` pass-through for `--version` and `--help` in `conda.xsh`. (#12344)
* Filter out `None` path values from `pwd.getpwall()` on Unix systems, for users without home directories, when running as root. (#12063)
* Catch `ChunkedEncodingError` exceptions to prevent network error tracebacks hitting the output. (#12196 via #12487)
* Fix race conditions in `mkdir_p_sudo_safe`. (#12490)

### Deprecations

* Drop `toolz.itertoolz.unique` in favor of custom `conda.common.iterators.unique` implementation. (#12252)
* Stop using `OrderedDict`/`odict` since `dict` preserves insert order since Python 3.7. (#12254)
* Mark `conda._vendor.boltons` for deprecation in 23.9.0. (#12272, #12482)
* Mark `conda_exe` in `context.py` and a topic in `print_package_info` `cli/main_info.py` for official deprecation. (#12398)
* Remove unused `chain`, `methodcaller`, `mkdtemp`, `StringIO` imports in `conda.common.compat`; apply other fixes from `ruff --fix .` in the test suite. (#12294)
* Remove unused optimization for searching packages based on `*[track_features=<feature name>]`. (#12314)
* Remove Notebook spec support from `conda env`; this was deprecated already and scheduled to be remove in version 4.5. (#12307)
* Mark `conda_exe` in `context.py` and a topic in `print_package_info` `cli/main_info.py` for official deprecation. (#12276)
* Marking `conda.utils.hashsum_file` as pending deprecation. Use `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_sum` instead. (#12414)
* Marking `conda.utils.md5_file` as pending deprecation. Use `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_sum(path, "md5")` instead. (#12414)
* Marking `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_md5sum` as pending deprecation. Use `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_sum(path, "md5")` instead. (#12414)
* Marking `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_sha256sum` as pending deprecation. Use `conda.gateways.disk.read.compute_sum(path, "sha256")` instead. (#12414)
* Drop Python 3.7 support. (#12436)

### Docs

* Added docs for `conda.deprecations`. (#12452)
* Updated some instances of "Anaconda Cloud" to be "Anaconda.org". (#12238)
* Added documentation on the specifications for `conda search` and `conda install`. (#12304)
* Mark `conda.utils.safe_open` for deprecation. Use builtin `open` instead. (#12415)

### Other

* Update `<cache key>.json.state` `repodata.json` cache format; check `mtime` against cached `repodata.json`. (#12090)
* Skip redundant `tar --no-same-owner` when running as root on Linux, since newer `conda-package-handling` avoids setting ownership from the archive. (#12231)
* Add additional extensions to `conda.common.path` for future use. (#12261)
* Pass `--cov` in test runner scripts but not in `setup.cfg` defaults, for easier debugging. (#12268)
* Constrain conda-build to at least >=3.18.3, released 2019-06-20. (#12309)
* Improve `start.bat` Windows development script. (#12311)
* Provide conda-forge-based Docker images and fix the bundled `minio` binary. (#12335)
* Add support for conda-forge-based CI runtimes. On Linux (all architectures), unit & integration tests will use Python 3.10. On Windows, Python 3.8. On macOS, only the unit tests are run with conda-forge (_instead_ of `defaults`!), using Python 3.9. (#12350, #12447 via #12448)
* Fix testing data issue where the `subdir` entry in some files was mismatched. (#12389)
* Initialize conda after installing test requirements during CI. (#12446)
* Speedup pre-commit by a factor of 15 by removing ignored hooks (`pylint`/`bandit`). This locally reduces the pre-commit runtime from ~43sec to 2.9sec and thus makes it possible to run pre-commit in a loop during development to constantly provide feedback and style the code. (#12466)

* Switch to `tqdm` as a real dependency. (#12005)
* Add a new plugin mechanism. (#11435)
* Add an informative message if explicit install fails due to requested packages not being in the cache. (#11591)
* Download and extract packages in parallel. Greatly speeds up package downloads when latency is high. Controlled by the new `fetch_threads` config parameter, defaulting to 5 parallel downloads. Thanks @shuges-uk for reporting. (#11841)
* Add a new plugin hook for virtual packages and convert existing code for virtual packages (from index.py) into plugins. (#11854)
* Require `ruamel.yaml`. (#11868, #11837)

* Also try UTF16 and UTF32 encodings when replacing the prefix. (#9946)

### Bug fixes

* `conda env update` would ask for user input and hang when working with pip installs of git repos and the repo was previously checked out. Tell pip not to ask for user input for that case.  (#11818)
* Fix for `conda update` and `conda install` issues related to channel notices. (#11852)

The same applies to the `--experimental-solver` flag, the `CONDA_EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER` environment variable, and the `ExperimentalSolverChoice` enum, which will be replaced by `--solver`, `EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER` and `SolverChoice`, respectively. (#11889)
* Mark `context.conda_private` as pending deprecation. (#12101)

## 22.9.0 (2022-09-14)

### Special announcement

If you have been following the conda project previously, you will notice a change in our version number for this release. We have officially switched to the [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning system as agreed upon in [CEP 8](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/blob/main/cep-8.md) (Conda Enhancement Proposal).

Please read that CEP for more information, but here is a quick synopsis. We hope that this versioning system and our release schedule will help make our releases more predictable and transparent to the community going forward. We are now committed to making at least one release every two months, but keep in mind that we can (and most likely will) be making minor version releases within this window.

### Enhancements

* Replace vendored toolz with toolz dependency. (#11589, #11700)
* Update bundled Python launchers for Windows (`conda/shell/cli-*.exe`) to match the ones found in conda-build. (#11676)
* Add `win-arm64` as a known platform (subdir). (#11778)

### Bug fixes

* Remove extra prefix injection related to the shell interface breaking `conda run`. (#11666)
* Better support for shebang instructions in prefixes with spaces. (#11676)
* Fix `noarch` entry points in Unicode-containing prefixes on Windows. (#11694)
* Ensure that exceptions that are raised show up properly instead of resulting in a blank `[y/N]` prompt. (#11746)

### Deprecations

* Mark `conda._vendor.toolz` as pending deprecation. (#11704)
* Removes vendored version of urllib3. (#11705)

### Docs

* Added conda capitalization standards to CONTRIBUTING file. (#11712)

### Other

* Add arm64 support to development script `. ./dev/start`. (#11752)
* Update canary-release version to resolve canary build issue. (#11761)
* Renamed canary recipe from `conda.recipe` to `recipe`. (#11774)

## 4.12.0 (2022-03-08)

### Enhancements

* Add support for libmamba integrations. (#11193)

  This is a new **experimental and opt-in** feature that allows use of the new
  [conda-libmamba-solver](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-libmamba-solver)
  for an improved user experience, based on the libmamba community project -
  the library version of the [mamba package manager](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba).

  Please follow these steps to try out the new libmamba solver integration:

  1. Make sure you have [conda-libmamba-solver](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-libmamba-solver)
     installed in your conda base environment.

  2. Try out the solver using the `--experimental-solver=libmamba` command line option.

     E.g. with a dry-run to install the ``scipy`` package:

     ```
     conda create -n demo scipy --dry-run --experimental-solver=libmamba
     ```

     Or install in an activated conda environment:

     ```
     conda activate my-environment
     conda install scipy --experimental-solver=libmamba
     ```

* Add periodic GitHub Actions workflow to review old issues in the conda issue tracker and mark them as stale if no feedback is provided in a sensible amount of time, eventually closing them.
* Add periodic GitHub Actions workflow to lock the comment threads of old issues and pull requests in the conda GitHub repository to surface regressions with new issues instead.
* Refactor test suite to use more GitHub Actions runners in parallel, reducing total run time by 50%.
* Switched the issue tracker to use forms with additional questions for bug reporters to help in ticket triage.
* Add and automatically run pre-commit as part of the CI system to improve the code quality continuously and raise issues in contributed patches early on.

  The used code linters are: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), [pylint](https://pylint.org/) and [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/).

  The [Python code formatter black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used as well but is only enforced on changed code in a commit and not to the whole code base at once.
* Automatically build the conda package upon the successful merge into the master branch and upload it to the conda-canary channel on anaconda.org.

  To try conda out simply run:

  ```
  conda install -c conda-canary/label/dev conda
  ```
* Automate adding new issues to [public GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/conda/projects/4) to facilitate issue triage.

* preload openssl on windows to avoid library conflicts and missing library issues (#8949)

### Bug fixes

* fix handling of channels where more than one channel contains packages with similar name, subdir, version and build_number.  This was causing mysterious unsatisfiable errors for some users.  (#8938)
* reverse logic check in checking channel equality, because == is not reciprocal to != with py27 (no `__ne__`) (#8938)
* fix an infinite loop or otherwise large process with building the unsatisfiable info.  Improve the depth-first search implementation.  (#8941)
* streamline fallback paths to unfrozen solve in case frozen fails. (#8942)
* Environment activation output only shows `conda activate envname` now, instead of sometimes showing just `activate`.  (#8947)

## 4.7.7 (2019-07-12)

### Improvements

* When an update command doesn't do anything because installed software conflicts with the update, information about the conflict is shown, rather than just saying "all requests are already satisfied"  (#8899)

## 4.7.3 (2019-06-14)

### Bug fixes

* target prefix overrid applies to entry points in addition to replacements in standard files  (#8769)
* Revert to solver-based unsatisfiability determination  (#8775)
* fix renaming of existing prompt function in powershell  (#8774)

## 4.7.2 (2019-06-10)

### Behavior changes

* unsatisfiability is determined in a slightly different way now. It no longer
  uses the SAT solver, but rather determines whether any specs have no
  candidates at all after running through get_reduced_index. This has been
  faster in benchmarks, but we welcome further data from your use cases about
  whether this was a good change.  (#8741)
* when using the --only-deps flag for the `install` command, conda now
  explicitly records those specs in your history. This primarily serves to
  reduce conda accidentally removing packages that you have actually requested.  (#8766)

### Improvements

* UnsatisfiableError messages are now grouped into categories and explained a bit better.  (#8741)
* --repodata-fn argument can be passed multiple times to have more fallback
  paths. `repodata_fns` conda config setting does the same thing, but saves you
  from needing to do it for every command invocation.  (#8741)

### Bug fixes

* fix channel flip-flopping that was happening when adding a channel other than earlier ones  (#8741)
* refactor flow control for multiple repodata files to not use exceptions  (#8741)
* force conda to use only old .tar.bz2 files if conda-build <3.18.3 is
  installed. Conda-build breaks when inspecting file contents, and this is fixed
  in conda-build 3.18.3 (#8741)
* use --force when using rsync to improve behavior with folders that may exist
  in the destination somehow. (#8750)
* handle EPERM errors when renaming, because MacOS lets you remove or create
  files, but not rename them. Thanks Apple. (#8755)
* fix conda removing packages installed via `install` with --only-deps flag when
  either `update` or `remove` commands are run. See behavior changes above.

## 4.7.1 (2019-05-30)

### Improvements

* Base initial solver specs map on explicitly requested specs (new and historic)  (#8689)
* Improve anonymization of automatic error reporting  (#8715)
* Add option to keep using .tar.bz2 files, in case new .conda isn't working for whatever reason  (#8723)

### Bug fixes

* fix parsing hyphenated PyPI specs (change hyphens in versions to .)  (#8688)
* fix PrefixRecord creation when file inputs are .conda files  (#8689)
* fix PrefixRecord creation for pip-installed packages  (#8689)
* fix progress bar stopping at 75% (no extract progress with new libarchive)  (#8689)
* preserve pre-4.7 download() interface in conda.exports  (#8698)
* virtual packages (such as cuda) are represented by leading double underscores
  by convention, to avoid confusion with existing single underscore packages
  that serve other purposes (#8738)

### Deprecations/Breaking Changes

* The `--prune` flag no longer does anything. Pruning is implicitly the
  standard behavior now as a result of the initial solver specs coming from
  explicitly requested specs. Conda will remove packages that are not explicitly
  requested and are not required directly or indirectly by any explicitly
  installed package.

### Docs improvements

* Document removal of the `free` channel from defaults (#8682)
* Add reference to conda config --describe  (#8712)
* Add a tutorial for .condarc modification  (#8737)

### New Feature Highlights
* A new flag, '--envs', has been added to 'conda search'. In this mode,
  'conda search' will look for the package query in existing conda environments
  on your system. If ran as UID 0 (i.e. root) on unix systems or as an
  Administrator user on Windows, all known conda environments for all users
  on the system will be searched.  For example, 'conda search --envs openssl'
  will show the openssl version and environment location for all
  conda-installed openssl packages.

### Recommended change to enable conda in your shell

With the release of conda 4.4, we recommend a change to how the `conda` command is made available to your shell environment. All the old methods still work as before, but you'll need the new method to enable the new `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` commands.

For the "Anaconda Prompt" on Windows, there is no change.

For Bourne shell derivatives (bash, zsh, dash, etc.), you likely currently have a line similar to

    export PATH="/opt/conda/bin:$PATH"

in your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.bash_profile` file on macOS).  The effect of this line is that your base environment is put on PATH, but without actually *activating* that environment. (In 4.4 we've renamed the 'root' environment to the 'base' environment.) With conda 4.4, we recommend removing the line where the `PATH` environment variable is modified, and replacing it with

    . /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base

In the above, it's assumed that `/opt/conda` is the location where you installed miniconda or Anaconda.  It may also be something like `~/Anaconda3` or `~/miniconda2`.

For system-wide conda installs, to make the `conda` command available to all users, rather than manipulating individual `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) files for each user, just execute once

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh

This will make the `conda` command itself available to all users, but conda's base (root) environment will *not* be activated by default.  Users will still need to run `conda activate base` to put the base environment on PATH and gain access to the executables in the base environment.

After updating to conda 4.4, we also recommend pinning conda to a specific channel.  For example, executing the command

    $ conda config --system --add pinned_packages conda-canary::conda

will make sure that whenever conda is installed or changed in an environment, the source of the package is always being pulled from the `conda-canary` channel.  This will be useful for people who use `conda-forge`, to prevent conda from flipping back and forth between 4.3 and 4.4.


### New Feature Highlights

* **conda activate**: The logic and mechanisms underlying environment activation have been reworked. With conda 4.4, `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` are now the preferred commands for activating and deactivating environments. You'll find they are much more snappy than the `source activate` and `source deactivate` commands from previous conda versions. The `conda activate` command also has advantages of (1) being universal across all OSes, shells, and platforms, and (2) not having path collisions with scripts from other packages like python virtualenv's activate script.


* **constrained, optional dependencies**: Conda now allows a package to constrain versions of other packages installed alongside it, even if those constrained packages are not themselves hard dependencies for that package. In other words, it lets a package specify that, if another package ends up being installed into an environment, it must at least conform to a certain version specification. In effect, constrained dependencies are a type of "reverse" dependency. It gives a tool to a parent package to exclude other packages from an environment that might otherwise want to depend on it.

  Constrained optional dependencies are supported starting with conda-build 3.0 (via [conda/conda-build#2001[(https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/2001)). A new `run_constrained` keyword, which takes a list of package specs similar to the `run` keyword, is recognized under the `requirements` section of `meta.yaml`. For backward compatibility with versions of conda older than 4.4, a requirement may be listed in both the `run` and the `run_constrained` section. In that case older versions of conda will see the package as a hard dependency, while conda 4.4 will understand that the package is meant to be optional.

  Optional, constrained dependencies end up in `repodata.json` under a `constrains` keyword, parallel to the `depends` keyword for a package's hard dependencies.


* **enhanced package query language**: Conda has a built-in query language for searching for and matching packages, what we often refer to as `MatchSpec`. The MatchSpec is what users input on the command line when they specify packages for `create`, `install`, `update`, and `remove` operations. With this release, MatchSpec (rather than a regex) becomes the default input for `conda search`. We have also substantially enhanced our MatchSpec query language.

  For example,

      conda install conda-forge::python

  is now a valid command, which specifies that regardless of the active list of channel priorities, the python package itself should come from the `conda-forge` channel. As before, the difference between `python=3.5` and `python==3.5` is that the first contains a "*fuzzy*" version while the second contains an *exact* version. The fuzzy spec will match all python packages with versions `>=3.5` and `<3.6`. The exact spec will match only python packages with version `3.5`, `3.5.0`, `3.5.0.0`, etc. The canonical string form for a MatchSpec is thus

      (channel::)name(version(build_string))

  which should feel natural to experienced conda users. Specifications however are often necessarily more complicated than this simple form can support, and for these situations we've extended the specification to include an optional square bracket `[]` component containing comma-separated key-value pairs to allow matching on most any field contained in a package's metadata. Take, for example,

      conda search 'conda-forge/linux-64::*[md5=e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7]' --info

  which results in information for the single package

  ```
  cytoolz 0.8.2 py35_0
  --------------------
  file name   : cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
  name        : cytoolz
  version     : 0.8.2
  build string: py35_0
  build number: 0
  size        : 1.1 MB
  arch        : x86_64
  platform    : Platform.linux
  license     : BSD 3-Clause
  subdir      : linux-64
  url         : https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
  md5         : e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7
  dependencies:
    - python 3.5*
    - toolz >=0.8.0
  ```

  The square bracket notation can also be used for any field that we match on outside the package name, and will override information given in the "simple form" position. To give a contrived example, `python==3.5[version='>=2.7,<2.8']` will match `2.7.*` versions and not `3.5`.


* **environments track user-requested state**: Building on our enhanced MatchSpec query language, conda environments now also track and differentiate (a) packages added to an environment because of an explicit user request from (b) packages brought into an environment to satisfy dependencies. For example, executing

      conda install conda-forge::scikit-learn

  will confine all future changes to the scikit-learn package in the environment to the conda-forge channel, until the spec is changed again. A subsequent command `conda install scikit-learn=0.18` would drop the `conda-forge` channel restriction from the package. And in this case, scikit-learn is the only user-defined spec, so the solver chooses dependencies from all configured channels and all available versions.


* **errors posted to core maintainers**: In previous versions of conda, unexpected errors resulted in a request for users to consider posting the error as a new issue on conda's github issue tracker. In conda 4.4, we've implemented a system for users to opt-in to sending that same error report via an HTTP POST request directly to the core maintainers.

  When an unexpected error is encountered, users are prompted with the error report followed by a `[y/N]` input. Users can elect to send the report, with 'no' being the default response. Users can also permanently opt-in or opt-out, thereby skipping the prompt altogether, using the boolean `report_errors` configuration parameter.


* **various UI improvements**: To push through some of the big leaps with transactions in conda 4.3, we accepted some regressions on progress bars and other user interface features. All of those indicators of progress, and more, have been brought back and further improved.


* **aggressive updates**: Conda now supports an `aggressive_update_packages` configuration parameter that holds a sequence of MatchSpec strings, in addition to the `pinned_packages` configuration parameter. Currently, the default value contains the packages `ca-certificates`, `certifi`, and `openssl`. When manipulating configuration with the `conda config` command, use of the `--system` and `--env` flags will be especially helpful here. For example,

      conda config --add aggressive_update_packages defaults::pyopenssl --system

  would ensure that, system-wide, solves on all environments enforce using the latest version of `pyopenssl` from the `defaults` channel.

      conda config --add pinned_packages python=2.7 --env

  would lock all solves for the current active environment to python versions matching `2.7.*`.


* **other configuration improvements**: In addition to `conda config --describe`, which shows detailed descriptions and default values for all available configuration parameters, we have a new `conda config --write-default` command. This new command simply writes the contents of `conda config --describe` to a condarc file, which is a great starter template. Without additional arguments, the command will write to the `.condarc` file in the user's home directory. The command also works with the `--system`, `--env`, and `--file` flags to write the contents to alternate locations.

  Conda exposes a tremendous amount of flexibility via configuration. For more information, [The Conda Configuration Engine for Power Users](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/conda-configuration-engine-power-users) blog post is a good resource.

* the conda 'root' environment is now generally referred to as the 'base' environment
* Conda 4.4 now warns when available information about per-path sha256 sums and file sizes

## 4.3.0 (2016-12-14)  Safety

### New Features
* **Unlink and Link Packages in a Single Transaction**: In the past, conda hasn't always been safe
  and defensive with its disk-mutating actions. It has gleefully clobbered existing files, and
  mid-operation failures leave environments completely broken. In some of the most severe examples,
  conda can appear to "uninstall itself." With this release, the unlinking and linking of packages
  for an executed command is done in a single transaction. If a failure occurs for any reason
  while conda is mutating files on disk, the environment will be returned its previous state.
  While we've implemented some pre-transaction checks (verifying package integrity for example),
  it's impossible to anticipate every failure mechanism. In some circumstances, OS file
  permissions cannot be fully known until an operation is attempted and fails. And conda itself
  is not without bugs. Moving forward, unforeseeable failures won't be catastrophic. (#3833, #4030)

* **Progressive Fetch and Extract Transactions**: Like package unlinking and linking, the
  download and extract phases of package handling have also been given transaction-like behavior.
  The distinction is the rollback on error is limited to a single package. Rather than rolling back
  the download and extract operation for all packages, the single-package rollback prevents the
  need for having to re-download every package if an error is encountered. (#4021, #4030)

* **Generic- and Python-Type Noarch/Universal Packages**: Along with conda-build 2.1.0, a
  noarch/universal type for python packages is officially supported. These are much like universal
  python wheels. Files in a python noarch package are linked into a prefix just like any other
  conda package, with the following additional features
  1. conda maps the `site-packages` directory to the correct location for the python version
     in the environment,
  2. conda maps the python-scripts directory to either $PREFIX/bin or $PREFIX/Scripts depending
     on platform,
  3. conda creates the python entry points specified in the conda-build recipe, and
  4. conda compiles pyc files at install time when prefix write permissions are guaranteed.

  Python noarch packages must be "fully universal."  They cannot have OS- or
  python version-specific dependencies.  They cannot have OS- or python version-specific "scripts"
  files. If these features are needed, traditional conda packages must be used. (#3712)

* **Multi-User Package Caches**: While the on-disk package cache structure has been preserved,
  the core logic implementing package cache handling has had a complete overhaul.  Writable and
  read-only package caches are fully supported. (#4021)

* **Python API Module**: An oft requested feature is the ability to use conda as a python library,
  obviating the need to "shell out" to another python process. Conda 4.3 includes a
  `conda.cli.python_api` module that facilitates this use case. While we maintain the user-facing
  command-line interface, conda commands can be executed in-process. There is also a
  `conda.exports` module to facilitate longer-term usage of conda as a library across conda
  conda releases.  However, conda's python code *is* considered internal and private, subject
  to change at any time across releases. At the moment, conda will not install itself into
  environments other than its original install environment. (#4028)

* **Remove All Locks**:  Locking has never been fully effective in conda, and it often created a
  false sense of security. In this release, multi-user package cache support has been
  implemented for improved safety by hard-linking packages in read-only caches to the user's
  primary user package cache. Still, users are cautioned that undefined behavior can result when
  conda is running in multiple process and operating on the same package caches and/or
  environments. (#3862)

### Deprecations/Breaking Changes
* Conda will refuse to clobber existing files that are not within the unlink instructions of
  the transaction. At the risk of being user-hostile, it's a step forward for conda. We do
  anticipate some growing pains. For example, conda will not clobber packages that have been
  installed with pip (or any other package manager). In other instances, conda packages that
  contain overlapping file paths but are from different package families will not install at
  the same time. The `--force` command line flag is the escape hatch. Using `--force` will
  let your operation proceed, but also makes clear that you want conda to do something it
  considers unsafe.
* Conda signed packages have been removed in 4.3. Vulnerabilities existed. An illusion of security
  is worse than not having the feature at all.  We will be incorporating The Update Framework
  into conda in a future feature release. (#4064)
* Conda 4.4 will drop support for older versions of conda-build.

## 4.2.0 (2016-07-28)  Configuration

### New Features
* **New Configuration Engine**: Configuration and "operating context" are the foundation of
  conda's functionality. Conda now has the ability to pull configuration information from a
  multitude of on-disk locations, including `.d` directories and a `.condarc` file *within*
  a conda environment), along with full `CONDA_` environment variable support. Helpful
  validation errors are given for improperly-specified configuration. Full documentation
  updates pending. (#2537, #3160, #3178)
* **New Exception Handling Engine**: Previous releases followed a pattern of premature exiting
  (with hard calls to `sys.exit()` when exceptional circumstances were encountered. This
  release replaces over 100 `sys.exit` calls with python exceptions.  For conda developers,
  this will result in tests that are easier to write.  For developers using conda, this is a
  first step on a long path toward conda being directly importable.  For conda users, this will
  eventually result in more helpful and descriptive errors messages.
  (#2899, #2993, #3016, #3152, #3045)
* **Empty Environments**: Conda can now create "empty" environments when no initial packages
  are specified, alleviating a common source of confusion. (#3072, #3174)
* **Conda in Private Env**: Conda can now be configured to live within its own private
  environment.  While it's not yet default behavior, this represents a first step toward
  separating the `root` environment into a "conda private" environment and a "user default"
  environment. (#3068)
* **Regex Version Specification**: Regular expressions are now valid version specifiers.
  For example, `^1\.[5-8]\.1$|2.2`. (#2933)

## 4.0.0 (2016-03-04)  Solver

* The solver has been retooled significantly. Performance
  should be improved in most circumstances, and a number of issues
  involving feature conflicts should be resolved.
* `conda update <package>` now handles dependencies properly
  according to the setting of the "update_deps" configuration:
      --update-deps: conda will also update any dependencies as needed
                     to install the latest version of the requested
                     packages.  The minimal set of changes required to
                     achieve this is sought.
      --no-update-deps: conda will update the packages *only* to the
                     extent that no updates to the dependencies are
                     required
  The previous behavior, which would update the packages without regard to
  their dependencies, could result in a broken configuration, and has been
  removed.

    always enabled (previously it would not run if there were more than ten
    specs). The new hint only gives one set of conflicting packages, rather
    than all sets, so multiple passes may be necessary to fix such issues
  * conda extensions that import conda should use
    conda.cli.conda_argparser.ArgumentParser instead of
    argparse.ArgumentParser to conform to the conda help guidelines (e.g., all
    help messages should be capitalized with periods, and the options should
    be preceded by "Options:" for the sake of help2man).

    assume that the dependencies are installed)
  * add --copy flag to install
  * prevent the progressbar from crashing conda when fetching in some
    situations


## 3.7.3 (2014-11-05)

    Windows
  * retain Unix style path separators for prefixes in has_prefix on
    Windows (if the placeholder path uses /, replace it with a path that uses
    /, not \)
  * fix bug in --use-local due to API changes in conda-build
  * include user site directories in conda info -s
  * make binary has_prefix replacement work with spaces after the prefix
  * make binary has_prefix replacement replace multiple occurrences of the
    placeholder in the same null-terminated string
  * don't show packages from other platforms as installed or cached in conda
    search
  * be more careful about not warning about conda itself in pscheck
  * Use a progress bar for the unsatisfiable packages hint generation
  * Don't use TemporaryFile in try_write, as it is too slow when it fails
  * Ignore InsecureRequestWarning when ssl_verify is False
  * conda remove removes features tracked by removed packages in

    1.0alpha that are not directly recognized by verlib's NormalizedVersion
    are supported better
  * conda run command, to run apps and commands from packages
  * more complete --json API. Every conda command should fully support --json

  * add --alt-hint as a method to get an alternate form of a hint for
    unsatisfiable packages
  * add conda package --ls-files to list files in a package
  * add ability to pin specs in an environment. To pin a spec, add a file
    called pinned to the environment's conda-meta directory with the specs to
    pin. Pinned specs are always kept installed, unless the --no-pin flag is
    used.
  * fix keyboard interrupting of external commands. Now keyboard interrupting
    conda build correctly removes the lock file
  * add no_link ability to conda, see issue #678


## 3.4.1 (2014-04-07)

  * always use a pkgs cache directory associated with an envs directory, even

    envs dir
  * add setting of PYTHONHOME to conda info --system
  * skip packages with bad metadata


## 3.4.0 (2014-04-02)

    line arguments, e.g. conda install 'numpy>=1.7', issue #624
  * fix error message for --file option when file does not exist
  * allow DEFAULTS in CONDA_ENVS_PATH, which expands to the defaults settings,

    by ',' for example: >=2.3,<3.0
  * add ability to disable self update of conda, by setting
    "self_update: False" in .condarc
  * Try installing packages using the old way of just installing the maximum
    versions of things first. This provides a major speedup of solving the
    package specifications in the cases where this scheme works.
  * Don't include python=3.3 in the specs automatically for the Python 3
    version of conda.  This allows you to do "conda create -n env package" for
    a package that only has a Python 2 version without specifying
    "python=2". This change has no effect in Python 2.
  * Automatically put symlinks to conda, activate, and deactivate in each
    environment on Unix.
  * On Unix, activate and deactivate now remove the root environment from the
    PATH. This should prevent "bleed through" issues with commands not
    installed in the activated environment but that are installed in the root
    environment. If you have "setup.py develop" installed conda on Unix, you
    should run this command again, as the activate and deactivate scripts have
    changed.
  * Begin work to support Python 3.4.
  * Fix a bug in version comparison
  * Fix usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr in environments like pythonw on
    Windows where they are nonstandard file descriptors.

  * print dots to the screen for progress
  * move logic functions from resolve to logic module


## 3.2.0a1 (2014-03-07)

  * conda now uses pseudo-boolean constraints in the SAT solver. This allows
    it to search for all versions at once, rather than only the latest (issue
    #491).
  * Conda contains a brand new logic submodule for converting pseudo-boolean
    constraints into SAT clauses.


## 3.1.1 (2014-03-07)

  * check if directory exists, fixed issue #591


## 3.1.0 (2014-03-07)

  * local packages in cache are now added to the index, this may be disabled
    by using the --known option, which only makes conda use index metadata
    from the known remote channels
  * add --use-index-cache option to enable using cache of channel index files
  * fix ownership of files when installing as root on Linux
  * conda search: add '.' symbol for extracted (cached) packages

## 3.0.3 (2014-02-06)

  * improve the speed of clean --lock
  * some fixes to conda config
  * more tests added

  * fix detection of prefix being writable


## 3.0.1 (2014-01-31)

  * bug: not having track_features in condarc now uses default again
  * improved test suite
  * remove numpy version being treated special in plan module
  * if the post-link.(bat|sh) fails, don't treat it as though it installed,
    i.e. it is not added to conda-meta
  * fix activate if CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV is invalid
  * fix conda config --get to work with list keys again
  * print the total download size
  * fix a bug that was preventing conda from working in Python 3
  * add ability to run pre-link script, issue #548


## 3.0.0 (2014-01-24)

  * removed build, convert, index, and skeleton commands, which are now
    part of the conda-build project: https://github.com/conda/conda-build
  * limited pip integration to `conda list`, that means
    `conda install` no longer calls `pip install` # !!!
  * add ability to call sub-commands named 'conda-x'
  * The -c flag to conda search is now shorthand for --channel, not
    --canonical (this is to be consistent with other conda commands)
  * allow changing location of .condarc file using the CONDARC environment
    variable
  * conda search now shows the channel that the package comes from
  * conda search has a new --platform flag for searching for packages in other
    platforms.
  * remove condarc warnings: issue #526#issuecomment-33195012


## 2.3.1 (2014-01-17)

  * add ability create info/no_softlink
  * add conda convert command to convert non-platform-dependent packages from
    one platform to another (experimental)
  * unify create, install, and update code. This adds many features to create
    and update that were previously only available to install. A backwards
    incompatible change is that conda create -f now means --force, not
    --file.


## 2.3.0 (2014-01-16)

  * automatically prepend http://conda.binstar.org/ (or the value of
    channel_alias in the .condarc file) to channels whenever the
    channel is not a URL or the word 'defaults or 'system'
  * recipes made with the skeleton pypi command will use setuptools instead of
    distribute
  * re-work the setuptools dependency and entry_point logic so that
    non console_script entry_points for packages with a dependency on
    setuptools will get correct build script with conda skeleton pypi
  * add -m, --mkdir option to conda install
  * add ability to disable soft-linking

  * conda config: automatically add the 'defaults' channel
  * conda build: improve error handling for invalid recipe directory
  * add ability to set build string, issue #425

  * add support for execution with the -m switch (issue #398), i.e. you
    can execute conda also as: python -m conda

  * add ability to preserve egg directory when building using
        build/preserve_egg_dir: True

  * fix prefix being replaced by placeholder after conda build on Unix
  * add 'use_pip' to condarc configuration file
  * fixed activate on Windows to set CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
  * allow setting "always_yes: True" in condarc file, which implies always
    using the --yes option whenever asked to proceed

  * fix rm_egg_dirs so that the .egg_info file can be a zip file
  * improve integration with pip
      * conda list now shows pip installed packages
      * conda install will try to install via "pip install" if no
        conda package is available (unless --no-pip is provided)

        will create a recipe (stored in <root>/conda-recipes) from pypi
        then build a conda package (and install it)
      * pip list and pip install only happen if pip is installed
  * enhance the locking mechanism so that conda can call itself in the same
    process.
